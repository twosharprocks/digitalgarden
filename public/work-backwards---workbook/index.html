<p>![[Meaning at Work.jpg]]
Relationships: NONE</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Work relationships don&rsquo;t mean very much to me. I&rsquo;m there to do a job, and I don&rsquo;t really need to make friends or interact with others to do it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Accomplishment: LOTS</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love getting things done, closing out projects, and generally putting the finishing touches on something I&rsquo;ve worked hard to complete.</p></blockquote>
<p>Prestige: NONE</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This means next to nothing to me. While I&rsquo;ve occasionally told folks I&rsquo;m proud to be in a certain role, that doesn&rsquo;t help me do that role in anyway, and it&rsquo;s often more of an offset for working somewhere I don&rsquo;t like.</p></blockquote>
<p>Community: SOME</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Community is not a vital part of the work I do, but I do get some meaning from it. While I like knowing I&rsquo;m helping out, and appreciate the support that others offer in turn, I will gladly work on something that I think will make the universe a nicer and more interesting place</p></blockquote>
<p>Teamwork: SOME</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Teamwork makes a job more fun and enjoyable when the team is effective, but it does not provide much meaning at work for me. I like being part of an effective team, however I often end up leading the teams I&rsquo;m in, and that responsibility is frustrating.</p></blockquote>
<p>Learning: LOTS</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Developing skills that help me do my job more effectively and efficiently is a huge source of meaning for me. If I&rsquo;m unhappy with my current job, then studying for my next role is one powerful way of managing that stress for me</p></blockquote>
<p>Freedom: LOTS</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is immensely important to me, and I relish personal agency in what I do with my days. I know what is important and what needs to be done, so being able to go about that in my own way and in an environment that supports my way of working is vital. Being able to do what needs to be done and then do other things that interest me is central to my attitude to work, and I find a huge amount of meaning by working in this way.</p></blockquote>
<p>I get meaning at work from:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A sense of <em>accomplishment</em>, from <em>learning new things</em> that help me do what I need to do, and having <em>freedom to approach my work and learning</em> in ways that best suit me. I love doing things that are important to me, I work until I forget to eat or go to the toilet, and I will learn whatever I need to learn to make my work easier or better. But in order to continue to produce good work each day, I know I need flexibility to approach the work in my own way and in my own time.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m proud of the caves I&rsquo;ve discovered and for winning the golden compass (accomplishment)
I&rsquo;m proud of my ability to adapt and survive so many different things (adaptability)
I&rsquo;m proud of being selected for Mars One and speaking about it around the world (accomplishment)
I&rsquo;m proud of writing two books &amp; delivering keynotes at huge events (accomplishment)
I&rsquo;m proud of my wide range of interests and skills (adaptability)</p>
<p>I get meaning outside of work from taking on difficult challenges and succeeding, even if the end product is messy and I didn&rsquo;t do it the &ldquo;right&rdquo; way. The challenge of the task is offset by my ability to be curious, to find hacks, and approach problems in ways that others may not have previously. I enjoy being able to do difficult things and have unique experiences because I&rsquo;m doing things in my own unique way.</p>
<h1 id="exercise-4---anchors">Exercise 4 - Anchors<a href="#exercise-4---anchors" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h1>
<hr>
<p>*Source of meaning: Discovering new caves and winning awards for it</p>
<ul>
<li>Why? Suspecting that something is there to be discovered, the sheer excitement of being right, and being celebrated for finding something that no one else did.</li>
<li>Why? Because I&rsquo;m smart even if I&rsquo;m weird, and it&rsquo;s reassuring to be proven right and have others acknowledge it</li>
<li>Why? Because I&rsquo;ve always felt I had so much to offer but I&rsquo;ve never felt like I fit in, and sharing something I&rsquo;ve discovered with others makes me feel like the effort is worth it</li>
<li>Why? <strong>Because I want to be acknowledged</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>*Source of meaning: adapting and surviving so many different things</p>
<ul>
<li>Why? Because I&rsquo;ve led an extraordinary life with all sorts of ups and downs</li>
<li>Why? Because often the things I&rsquo;ve tried to do have failed or gone wrong, and I&rsquo;ve needed to keep moving forward to survive</li>
<li>Why? Because I try to do unusual and challenging things for the experience, regardless of the likelihood of success</li>
<li>Why? Because I&rsquo;d rather die doing something adventurous than live being boring</li>
</ul>
<p>*Source of meaning: being selected for Mars One and speaking about it around the world</p>
<ul>
<li>Why? Because it was an acknowledgement of my abilities, personality and dedication to an extraordinary project.</li>
<li>Why? Because I had the opportunity to contribute to something that would change the way we saw ourselves as a species, to directly contribute to our evolution to become a space-fairing civilisation</li>
<li>Why? Because since I was a kid I&rsquo;ve wanted to explore the universe and share the raw excitement for existence with the rest of our species</li>
<li>Why? Because I&rsquo;ve always felt a wonder for the beauty of space and the universe generally, and believe that we have an obligation to learn more about both by exploring it</li>
</ul>
<p>*Source of meaning: writing two books &amp; delivering keynotes at huge events</p>
<ul>
<li>Why? Standing in front of an audience is terrifying, but I put my heart and soul into both of those books, I know what I&rsquo;m talking about, and people want to understand what would motivate someone like me to commit to the dream of life on Mars enough to write 2 books and stand on stage talking about it</li>
<li>Why? Writing a book is an immense prospect, and you&rsquo;ve done it twice. You intend to do it another 8 times in your life, because it&rsquo;s the best way for you to process and share your thoughts - understand your own mind, and to release the ideas that bind you up</li>
<li>Why? Because expression is a key part of who you are as an artist and as a human, and if you don&rsquo;t work that expressive muscle then you become weak and bitter as your dreams and ideas rot inside you</li>
<li>Why? Because life is for living and expression, and the best way you&rsquo;ve found to express your intentions and dreams, and to release them from your mind&hellip; is to write them down and publish them in a book</li>
</ul>
<p>*Source of meaning: having a wide range of interests and skills</p>
<ul>
<li>Why? Because you&rsquo;ve felt yourself capable of an extraordinary number of different things, and so you&rsquo;ve felt pulled in a wide range of different directions to try them all</li>
<li>Why? Because if you&rsquo;re not trying something new and novel, you feel like your face is being slowly ground away by tedium. You want to live a live and engaged life, and if you don&rsquo;t have something substantial to pour your entire being into, then you feel like chasing many of the other shiny beads around you</li>
<li>Why? Because you have had ADHD all your life, and while you&rsquo;ve developed your own ways of managing it it&rsquo;s still there pulling you in a dozen different directions at once.</li>
<li>Why? Because that&rsquo;s the hand I was dealt, and while I&rsquo;ve striven to organise myself, the only thing that has ever truly felt like it ordered my mind was writing books</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>What you value highly in the way you live your life</p>
<ul>
<li>Flexibility</li>
<li>Adventure</li>
<li>Uniqueness</li>
<li>Creativity</li>
<li>Curiosity</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Other Anchors: Adaptability, Boldness, Freedom, Fairness, Honesty, Integrity, Respect</em></p>

<h1 id="exercise---user-manual">Exercise - User Manual<a href="#exercise---user-manual" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h1>
<p>About me:
I&rsquo;m a diverse and multi-skilled worker who loves tackling hard problems, developing efficient processes, and being able to focus on creative work which engages and interests me.</p>
<p>When I like to work:
I like to work in two blocks -pre-prepared work in the morning, a decent break over lunch/afternoon, and then a second block after dinner. Generally I like to work at night as it&rsquo;s cool, dark, and the chances of being distracted by people and messages is reduced.</p>
<p>How I like to communicate:
I like to send emails so there&rsquo;s a document trail that I and other people can look at later for details that may have been missed verbally, and I always try to aim for inbox-zero. Phone is good for connection, but I always forget details on the phone so I&rsquo;ll generally follow up with an email after making a personal connection in person or mobile</p>
<p>My superpower:
Being able to connect a diverse range of different skills and viewpoints on the problem at hand. If I&rsquo;m engaged in a problem, I&rsquo;ll work until I forget to eat as I draw in ideas and concepts from across my wide range of experiences</p>
<p>How I like to receive feedback:
Clear details on whether I&rsquo;ve achieved the outcomes required, and how to improve on things next time. I&rsquo;m very much about doing what&rsquo;s required and only putting in additional effort and flourishes if there is a clear benefit to be gained for my well-being.</p>
<p>How I like to learn:
Collecting information from a wide range of areas, summarising it into bite-size and relevant chunks, and then assembling those chunks into a final product that others can learn from as well.</p>
<p>What I need from you:
To tell me what I need to do and what role it plays in the larger effort. Don&rsquo;t try to sell me on work that doesn&rsquo;t align with my goals - I will gladly do shit work if I can see it contributes to goals I believe in, but trying to persuade me of something when there&rsquo;s no tangible evidence to back it up will cause me to resist you</p>
<p>What I struggle with:
Being asked to do work that doesn&rsquo;t fulfil a genuine purpose. If reports need to be written for compliance, then they&rsquo;ll be written. If a graph needs to be changed because an exec or HR person doesn&rsquo;t like the colour used, then I&rsquo;m going to do it but resent the time wasted.</p>
<p>Something about me that might surprise you:
I&rsquo;m a claustrophobic cave diver</p>
