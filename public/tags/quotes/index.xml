      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fear is the mind killer&amp;rdquo; is the most easily recognised line from the &amp;ldquo;Litany Against Fear&amp;rdquo; from the Dune universe. Recited by high-born characters in times of high stress or when death threatens, it acts to centre and stabilise the emotions of those who recited it through the application of cold logic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Accepting fear and allowing it to pass over you is vital to remaining in control when it could take control of your mind. In the universe of Dune, the litany is adopted as a vaccine to a digital virus that feeds on fear. However it&amp;rsquo;s origin can be traced back to Act II of Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Julius Caesar&lt;/em&gt;, in a quote which has been adapted numerous times - most notably paraphrased as &amp;ldquo;A coward dies a thousand deaths, but the brave die only once&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
