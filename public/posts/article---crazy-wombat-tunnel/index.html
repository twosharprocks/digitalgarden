<hr>
<p>It all started with a simple question: &ldquo;What the hell is that empty black area?&rdquo;. Will had just finished several dozen dives in Pines Cave to collect photogrammetry data, and he was just starting the painstaking, months-long process of using Metashape to turn the 10&rsquo;s of thousands of still images he&rsquo;d collected into a high resolution 3D model. Eventually, that 3D model would lead to a game-changing map to support new divers experiencing one of the most renowned and frequently dived cave sites in the Mount Gambier region.</p>
<p>But I couldn&rsquo;t see that yet. It was August 2024 - Will was hard at work and proudly sending me screenshots of the model&rsquo;s point cloud, but all I could see was an absolutely massive gap in the data on the northern side of the Crazy Czech Room - the end of the known cave.</p>
<p>The Crazy Czech Room (aka the &ldquo;CCR&rdquo;) is unusual for being a 20m wide room created by rocks collapsing directly under a road which large forestry trucks drive over, and since it was discovered by two visiting Czech cave divers in 2002 it&rsquo;s been the end of the known tunnel in Pines Cave. Getting to the CCR requires weaving through a rock maze down to 34m, jumping across to the &ldquo;Surprise Tunnel&rdquo; and swimming at depth for ~70m, before weaving back up a rockpile to 14m into the room itself. Will and I had been diving together to the Crazy Czech Room for years, and I knew that he&rsquo;d scanned it with the photogrammetry rig pretty comprehensively, so there was no way he just happened to miss an entire side of it. I also knew this photogrammetry business could be tricky, but given Will&rsquo;s experience surely there wouldn&rsquo;t be issues with modelling a chamber this big and open?</p>
<p>For years Will had been testing and refining his photogrammetry setup, and after a lot of testing and tweaking in a wide variety of dive sites, it felt like he&rsquo;d worked out a lot of the quirks. Collecting the data itself however was still a lot of hard work - swimming slowly into a cave while repeatedly twisting this heavy rig (carrying 4 GoPros and 3 BigBlue lights) back and forth in order to scan all the walls, then needing to do it all over again on the swim back out. But the level of detail Will could achieve with this setup was absolutely extraordinary. When the Soggy Wombats discovered the Iddlebiddy Extension, one section was found to be covered with pristine and exquisitely-coloured clay blocks. After I swam Will&rsquo;s photogrammetry rig through this section, the 3D model he then produced was detailed enough to display the individual, millimetre-wide bands of colour in every single clay block.</p>
<p>The only time the modelling seemed to have issues was when the cameras couldn&rsquo;t get &ldquo;alignment&rdquo; by matching details on the walls between sequential images. This was generally because the camera view had changed too rapidly because the diver had pushed the rig too quickly through somewhere very tight, or because silt had obscured the details in the rocks and walls. Swimming slowly around a big, open room like the CCR with a ton of light and four GoPro&rsquo;s running, seeing a massive gap in the model from any alignment issue just didn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>We also had absolutely perfect modelling of the South-Western side of the Crazy Czech Room - an area that was a lot smaller and siltier than the rest, and where I had long suspected we&rsquo;d find more tunnel if we just looked hard enough. The model clearly showed the South-Western side was a dead-end though, with all the leads I&rsquo;d hoped to go back to shown to be just loose boulders half buried in clay and leaning against impenetrable walls of dolomite.</p>
<p>The utter completeness of the model on the South-Western side of the Crazy Czech Room only deepened the mystery around the dark and incomplete modelling Will had of the northern side. It was as if all these GoPro&rsquo;s and lights somehow couldn&rsquo;t see an obvious limestone wall. The only other reason explaination for why the GoPro&rsquo;s weren&rsquo;t seeing a solid wall on the north side of the CCR was if <em>it wasn&rsquo;t actually a solid wall</em>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an old saying in cave exploration - you haven&rsquo;t really checked a cave until you&rsquo;ve touched every wall. Gaps in the cave roof, floor, or a wall can easily unnoticed until you&rsquo;re right on top of it, so you before you can truly say &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way on&rdquo; you have to physically place yourself to the furthest point inside every &ldquo;dead end&rdquo; and really look. Even the &ldquo;Surprise Tunnel&rdquo; in Pines was found because someone floated up to the roof of a chamber everyone thought was a &ldquo;dead end&rdquo;, and then spotted an angled restriction that was invisible to anyone following the line at the bottom of the room. But Will&rsquo;s photogrammetry data was starting to show us something we couldn&rsquo;t have predicted - we could find leads and new tunnels by looking for what the photogrammetry data <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> show.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d experienced something vaguely similar a year earlier in Iddlebiddy cave, where Will was collecting photogrammetry data while I was poking my head into random holes hoping they&rsquo;d lead somewhere. There were clear gaps in the model when Will scanned the jumbled rockpile West of the cave&rsquo;s entrance, but we figured it was caused by the cameras moving too quickly along with a lack of light and experience. It was only when we returned to scan that section again more slowly that I spotted a hole in the roof - a hole which led to a newly discovered surface lake, and eventually to the 100m of new tunnel we named the &ldquo;Iddlebiddy Extension&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Will couldn&rsquo;t get to Mount gambier for a few months, so he couldn&rsquo;t do another photogrammetry scan of the Crazy Czech Room to try and fill the gaps in the model. Instead, I decided to investigate the northern side of the CCR to figure out if the gaps in the photogrammetry data were real or not. It didn&rsquo;t take long to figure out that those gaps are very real, and we would never have looked for them if the photogrammetry data hadn&rsquo;t shown something was missing.</p>
<p>Swimming to the northern side of the rockpile in the Crazy Czech Room, there was a small vertical drop into a low and very silty flattner. Squeezing down into it, two things immediately struck me;</p>
<ol>
<li>I could easily shine my light back out into the CCR between a series of loose rocks on the left side of the flattener, and realised those rocks had obscured the view of the flattener for anyone trying to spot it from the CCR, and</li>
<li>The flattener was full of clay and yellow silt, but the visibility would clear surprisingly quickly as soon as I stopped moving.</li>
</ol>
<p>Looking ahead, I could see a stark white wall that contrasted with the 40cm high flattener of full yellow clay I had squeezed into. Not being able to see clay against the white wall ahead (and knowing a cave hasn&rsquo;t been properly checked until you&rsquo;ve reached every wall) I wriggled forward a couple of meters to find the floor of the flattener suddenly dropped away, and another flattener opened up at 90 degrees to my left. This second flattener was on an aggressive angle and looked incredibly tight - the sort of thing that required a wetsuit and 7L cylinders to get through, rather than the drysuit and 12L cylinders I was currently using.</p>
<p>Luckily I&rsquo;d brought the cave explorer&rsquo;s secret weapon - a GoPro and fill light on the end of a selfie stick.</p>
<p>I pulled the selfie stick out of my pocket, turned the light and camera on, set it to record, then jammed it through the restriction and hoped. With no way to see the GoPro&rsquo;s display, all you can do in these situations is slowly twist the camera and light around and hope that you&rsquo;re not filming close-ups of wet rocks, or worse that a smear of clay is covering the GoPro&rsquo;s lens. I spun the selfie stick around a few times, tried waving it around to see if I&rsquo;d bump anything on the other side (it didn&rsquo;t), then started to pull the selfie stick back so I could back out of the cave with my buddy - we still had a 200m swim back to the surface through a nasty U-shaped depth profile, and neither of us wanted to accrue endless deco because I&rsquo;d spent too long poking around in some silly little clay-filled hole.</p>
<p>As I pulled the GoPro back through the flattener it clipped the roof a little, creating a shower of silt. I pushed the selfie stick back in to line up the gap properly and try again, but I froze when I saw the silt from impact was suddenly moving <em>towards</em> me. That made no sense - if anything the water movement from pushing the GoPro back away from me should have pulled any silt with it, but here it was clearly moving towards me? That&rsquo;s when the lightbulb came on - there was flow coming through this flattener! Visible water flow through Mount Gambier caves is incredibly rare, but when see it there&rsquo;s generally something <em>big</em> ahead that&rsquo;s pushing water into a small space. No one had ever reported any kind of water movement in Pines before, yet here I was looking at clear evidence of flow. And that flow was coming from a flattener leading <em>out</em> of the Crazy Czech Room!.</p>
<p>Back in the main cavern clearing deco, I tried to explain to my buddy what I&rsquo;d found, but in my excitement all I could think to write on my wrist slate was &ldquo;BIG LEAD FOUND FLOW&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src="/images/found-flow.jpg" alt="Image Description"></p>
<p>Back at the accommodation we immediately plugged in the GoPro and downloaded the footage from the selfie stick - sure enough there was a decent size room on the other side. It was a jumbled room inside a rockpile and scary looking suspended boulders, but a room which was plenty big enough to turn around inside of AND big enough to hide the way onward.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d take another month before Will and I could get back together at Pines Cave, but we both knew we were now onto something big. Using a series of stage cylinders I managed to get back to the second flattener with 7L cylinders and wetsuit, and then squeezed through into the jumbled room we&rsquo;d seen on from the GoPro on the selfie stick. It felt like there were leads everywhere, but they were almost all deadends much - boulders leaning against solid walls much like we&rsquo;d seen in the South-Western corner of the Crazy Czech Room, only without any clay or silt because the small amount of flow was keeping everything clean.</p>
<p>Finding the way out of the jumble room would take nearly a dozen dives - each time wriggling through that tight and aggressively angle flattener, and each time it getting a little bit easier as the limestone slowly wore down from me grinding my way through it. I&rsquo;d managed to find a way out of the jumble room, and then pick my way under, over and between the boulders in the rockpile to a point about 5m below the centre of the Crazy Czech Room&hellip; but everywhere I looked, all I could see was boulders leaning against solid walls, or deep hollows full of trapped clay. Getting Will&rsquo;s photogrammetry rig in to help wasn&rsquo;t an option at this stage either - the whole rockpile was just too small, silty, and with no clear path through it meant every attempt to image and model it devolved into a mess of imagery mis-alignment.</p>
<p>After a nearly dozen dives poking through this rockpile though, I was also about ready to give up. Sure we&rsquo;d made some amazing progress, the flow was very exciting, and I hadn&rsquo;t checked <em>every</em> hole or wall. But wriggling and poking between these boulders inside a rockpile while this far back in a complex cave was getting scary, and I was starting to suspect the flow I&rsquo;d noticed in the flattener was being fed by an impassable, 10cm wide vertical fissure I&rsquo;d spotted the first time I popped into the jumble room.</p>
<p>Now being able to squeeze in on 12L cylinders and a drysuit though, I had a little more time and air to look for a potential way out of the rockpile. I&rsquo;d  gotten to the deepest point I could find in the rockpile at around 22m, couldn&rsquo;t find anything but solid walls and boulders, and was getting close to turn pressure when I decided to turn around and head out of the cave when. Frustrated at another big dive without finding the next big lead, I locked and dumped the reel, then started to turn around to shine my light back the way I&rsquo;d come. As I turned though, my eyes caught the flicker of an unexpected shadow - it&rsquo;s that supposed to be another solid wall?</p>
<p>I swam back along the line to where I&rsquo;d just seen the shadow and moved my light around. Sure enough there was a basketball sized rock sitting on a small mound of silt, and a solid dark wall about half a meter behind it. I moved the basket-ball sized rock out of the way and looked a hole only slightly larger than it to see the dark wall behind was <em>phreatic!</em> Everything else I&rsquo;d seen in the rockpile was either the limestone that fallen off the roof and walls in a collapse, or the exposed walls left behind by the same collapse. Phreatic passage is formed by water moving underground through tunnels which deposit minerals on the walls, and has an orange-brown colour which sets it apart from the bone-white of limestone rock collapse. There was also clear flow coming through this hole straight towards me - a sure sign I&rsquo;d found the way out of the rockpile and into something very exciting.</p>
<p>Seeing a potential way out of the rockpile, but wearing a drysuit and 12L cylinders, I was presented with the same challenge I&rsquo;d had when I first found the flattener into the rockpile - how do I know there&rsquo;s enough room on the other side of this restriction to get safely back out? Luckily I had my secret weapon again, so I dragged out the GoPro/Fill-Light/Selfie-Stick combo out of my drysuit pocket, turned it all on, jammed it through, and hoped once again.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t both writing a note to Will on my wrist slate this time - we&rsquo;d talk about my potential lead on the surface, but there was no point getting excited just yet. I&rsquo;d done plenty of dives into this rockpile, and while a phreatic wall was exciting there was no telling if there was actually any space on the other side of the restriction without looking carefully at the GoPro footage on a laptop screen. So we drove back to the accommodation, copied the video across, and hit play.</p>
<p>[VIDEO]</p>
<p>Looking at the footage, it&rsquo;d be tight but there was definitely space to turn around on the other side. Better yet, there were several big dark areas down below that the selfie stick&rsquo;s fill-light couldn&rsquo;t light up. And the nearby walls that it could light up? They were ALL phreatic. This was it - we&rsquo;d just found solid evidence of an unexplored phreatic passage with measurable flow in one of the region&rsquo;s most well-known caves!</p>
<p>The very next day we were back for the big push. I picked up the reel I&rsquo;d locked the day before, and wound it back in until I was in-front of the hole I&rsquo;d spotted the phreatic wall through. There was no way the hole was big enough to wriggle straight through, so I unclipped one of my 12L cylinders, swung it in front of me, and the started to push through. The restriction was a lot tighter than the flattener that had let me into the rockpile, but it was also a lot shorter - instead of dragging myself through several meters of squeeze, it was an uncomfortably tight pinch that was only half a meter long. As soon as I was through, the only way on was <em>down</em>.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t enough room to clip my cylinder back on behind me, so I just kept it in front of me as I dropped straight through a small phreatic passage and suddenly popped out into an inky black room. I&rsquo;d dropped nearly 10m straight down, and with my exploration reel in one hand and my cylinder in the other, there was absolutely no way inflate my wing or drysuit and stop from crashing directly into the pitch black silt at the bottom. Locking the reel, I pumped gas into my drysuit to ease the squeeze and get off the bottom, before clipping my cylinder back into place and looking around.</p>
<p>My crash landing had clouded the room in a heartbeat, but it was obvious that there was flow in this room too. Near the bottom at 34m the silt hung unmoving, but 30cm from the roof it was crystal clear with a distinct &ldquo;silt-cline&rdquo; separating the clear water running along the roof from the murky mess below. Looking through the clear water near the roof I could see more boulders and open space continuing North, so I headed that way until the roof opened up slightly and I spotted another opening in the wall to the South.</p>
<p>Folks often ask what it&rsquo;s like to find new tunnels underwater. Most of the time it&rsquo;s a lot of hard and boring work knowing you&rsquo;re probably onto something, but that something might just be another small room that leads nowhere. As exciting as it was finding this murky black room (which we later named &ldquo;The Void&rdquo;), deep down I was certain it&rsquo;d turn out to be another dead end - a small and short new piece of cave you could tell folks about, but not something worth the effort of getting to for most divers.</p>
<p>Very rarely though, you&rsquo;ll poke your head into a new hole and be rendered entirely dumbstruck. I first experienced it when I wriggled down a silty tunnel in Englebrecht&rsquo;s East and popped out into a previously undiscovered room 30m wide which led to a &gt;400m extension to a cave people thought was only 50m long. The next time I felt it was looking up through that hole in Iddlebiddy and seeing my exhaled bubbles break on the surface of a lake above. And I felt it as I swam out of the Void, through the opening in the wall to the South, and into a 10m high and 15m wide gallery that we&rsquo;d quickly christen the &ldquo;Crazy Wombat Tunnel&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Running the line would be easy, because this tunnel just kept going on and up. After swimming up to a rock as far as I could see, I looked over it and saw the tunnel kept going on the other side. After dipping through a low point, I was faced with another huge room which was utterly dominated by yet another rockpile. Only this wasn&rsquo;t the rockpile that a visitor to the Crazy Czech Room might see - this was a rockpile 100m deeper into the cave that no living being had ever seen before.</p>
<p>I tied off the line at the top of the rockpile, looked briefly for a way on, and then turned for home. There was no way anyone would believe that I&rsquo;d just 100m of new line in a cave that we&rsquo;d been told was &ldquo;fully explored&rdquo; two decades before&hellip; at least not without footage.</p>
<p>We were right back the very next day, but this time I came armed with a new secret weapon - an Insta360 X4 camera. I&rsquo;d been trialling the X4 for a few months in the ocean and large cavern areas to figure out how to setup the lights to capture as much as possible while being as unobtrusive to diving as possible. I&rsquo;d even brought it along on an earlier dive to the Crazy Czech Room with some of the my fellow Soggy Wombats, before dropping it off to try and find a way through the rockpile again. This time I knew I could get through the rockpile, that there was an enormous tunnel on the other side, and the best way to capture the journey was on a 360 camera.</p>
<p>And the best bit about filming it all on a 360 camera, besides just to prove you did it? By slicing out frames from the footage, we were then able to process the spherical images with Metashape to start creating a 3D model of what we&rsquo;d found. The images from a 360 camera are about ~10 times lower resolution than the collective resolution of Will&rsquo;s photogrammetry rig, so the model lacks the same details but the shape of the cave is still accurate. It&rsquo;s also a whole lot easier pushing a 360 camera through a restriction than it is pushing a full-sized photogrammetry rig!</p>
<p>Naturally collecting photogrammetry data in a new section of cave also means producing new models and maps, as well as potential new leads to check whenever there&rsquo;s a dark gap in the data. The new model of the Crazy Wombat Tunnel puts the current end of Pines cave just 15m away from another of the area&rsquo;s well-known caves - Stinging Nettle! The dive-able part of Stinging Nettle runs to the north of the doline, while the end of the Crazy Wombat Tunnel is close to the Southern side. But there&rsquo;s still good evidence for a connection, as the south-side of the Stinging Nettle doline has a small, dry drainage hole that appears to be pointing directly towards the newly discovered tunnel.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if our Soggy Wombats team will find a connection to Stinging Nettle, or if we&rsquo;ll find a way around the new rockpile at the end of the Crazy Wombat Tunnel. But one thing is for certain - we would never have found any of it without collecting and processing photogrammetry data, or by asking &ldquo;What&rsquo;s missing here?&rdquo;. By using a variety of cameras, we&rsquo;ve been able to produce 3D models which help us spot new leads in caves, which we can then check safely with a selfie stick before someone tries to squeeze in. Rather being toys for filming each other doing cool things underwater, we&rsquo;re using these cameras to collect scientific data which furthers our understanding of these caves and directly enable the kind of exploration that allows our team to make new discoveries in caves that were dismissed for decades as &ldquo;already explored&rdquo;.</p>
