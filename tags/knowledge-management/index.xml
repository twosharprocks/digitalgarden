      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;digital-gardens&#34;&gt;Digital Gardens&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the internet has been overwhelmingly consumed with a &amp;ldquo;feed&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;stream&amp;rdquo; style where information and opinions are delivered as an unalterable fact, the early days of the internet were far more collaborative and interwoven.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The earliest web pages behaved much like a digital &amp;ldquo;garden&amp;rdquo; rather than a feed or chronological blog - posts and snippets of information being woven together in a dense tapestry that was always evolving and interlinking. While a feed provides the most recent and &amp;ldquo;important&amp;rdquo; content at the top, a digital garden provides a wide array of entry points and no two journey&amp;rsquo;s through it are the same. For the last 20 years the internet has evolved into a broad array of feeds all vying for the attention of visitors, delivering the latest and greatest at all times.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mini Essay - 2 - Fear Is The Mind Killer</title>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fear is the mind killer&amp;rdquo; is the most easily recognised line from the &amp;ldquo;Litany Against Fear&amp;rdquo; from the Dune universe. Recited by high-born characters in times of high stress or when death threatens, it acts to centre and stabilise the emotions of those who recited it through the application of cold logic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Accepting fear and allowing it to pass over you is vital to remaining in control when it could take control of your mind. In the universe of Dune, the litany is adopted as a vaccine to a digital virus that feeds on fear. However it&amp;rsquo;s origin can be traced back to Act II of Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Julius Caesar&lt;/em&gt;, in a quote which has been adapted numerous times - most notably paraphrased as &amp;ldquo;A coward dies a thousand deaths, but the brave die only once&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
