# Digital Gardens

While the internet has been overwhelmingly consumed with a "feed" or "stream" style where information and opinions are delivered as an unalterable fact, the early days of the internet were far more collaborative and interwoven. 

The earliest web pages behaved much like a digital "garden" rather than a feed or chronological blog - posts and snippets of information being woven together in a dense tapestry that was always evolving and interlinking. While a feed provides the most recent and "important" content at the top, a digital garden provides a wide array of entry points and no two journey's through it are the same. For the last 20 years the internet has evolved into a broad array of feeds all vying for the attention of visitors, delivering the latest and greatest at all times. 

Whereas a digital garden doesn't strive for perfection or relevance - it simply grows through cultivation and contribution, developing over time into a wealth of knowledge and ideas. Connection is critical in a digital garden, as any snippet of information in it - a mini essay like this, a series of interesting links, brief thoughts on another article - is meaningless in isolation, but feeds an incredible web of possibility when it's linked to a wide array of other snippets. 

In much the same way a brain operates, the notes and snippets are individual synapses - the real power comes from the connections between those synapses, and the way that waves of activity passing through those connections creates new ideas and opportunities which are far bigger than the sum of the parts.

Digital gardens offer a vital alternative to the relentless stream of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and all the other sources of "content" which deliver knowledge and novelty, but provide little opportunity for the development of wisdom or even genuine engagement. Rather than being hooked into the addictive cycle of checking the "latest" on social media, I'm going to strive to cultivate my own digital garden whenever I can.
