# Other Notes
Food
- Chicken & Fish are staples 
	- No pig-products available, beef/lamb is very rare
- White Rice: Generally very starchy & often unwashed, consume in small quantities and watch for reflux.
- Chilli: Mild chilli is often found blended with noodles, chicken and fish. Watch out for occasional chunks of chilli. 
	- Sauce/"Samba": *Be careful of chilli seeds/puree in sauces*. Black samba looks like thick soy sauce and is usually full of chilli seeds.

Drink
- Tea & Instant Coffee - Filter coffee is available from reception at Kadena Glamping, but there are kettles in the rooms so strongly recommend taking sachet coffee bags. *Milk is often limited or unavailable*
- Alcohol - Beer and wine are available in limited supply (no spirits available)
	- Moonshine - Spirits are manufactured illegally in small quantities on Muna island using palm leaves. *Methanol poisoning is possible - consume at your own risk*

Cash
- Only expense on Muna is toiletries and ice-creams (generally ~12k-30k each from a supermarket after a diving). 
- Recommend getting out 1 million Rp for safety
- Wise card 
	- Visit an ATM in Denpasar or Makassar 
		- Very few ATMs in Baubau, no ATMs on Muna Island
	- Take a physical cash card
		- ATMs require a physical card for cash withdrawl
		- Airline counters often only have a card swipe (no chip reader) if you need to pay for excess luggage or a flight change.
	- Digital card (on phone) will work with tap'n'go 
		- Tap'n'go at cafes/shops in Denpasar & Makassar
		- Tap'n'go at the reception of Kadena Glamping on Muna Island (payment of drinks at check-out)

Logistics
- Driving & Site access 
	- All organised through the operator. Self-drive is strongly discouraged, and unnecessary with an operator. Do not attempt to access dive sites without the support of an operator.
- Flights
	- Getting to BAU
		- DPS to UPG: Flights are generally on-time and consistent. *Arrive at DPS Domestic >2 hours to get through baggage check, ticket issue, and gate security*
		- UPG to BAU: Aircraft are small and flights often changed/rescheduled. Book to depart UPG mid-afternoon for greatest reliability.
	- Leaving from BAU
		- BAU to UPG: *Only the 0630 departure is reliable, and Baubau airport does not open until 0530*. Be aware that afternoon/evening flights are regularly changed/cancelled without warning. 
		- UPG to DPS: *All flights from UPG to DPS are regularly delayed by 2.5-3.5 hours*. Allow >6 hours between your scheduled arrival at DPS and any departing international flight.
- Ferries 
	- Car Ferry: Runs 3x per day on a schedule. Be sure to line up early to ensure a vehicle place onboard 
	- "Fast boats": Wooden/fibreglass transport boats with no schedule which leave once they have a full passenger load.
- Hotels
	- Baubau: Zenith Hotel 
		- Excellent rooms and great buffet breakfast. You'll only stay at Zenith the night you land in Baubau (likely diving Gua Lanto the next morning) or the night before you fly out of Baubau (getting a taxi to the airport at 0500)

		- Excellent accommodation all around. They will handle your airport transfer from/to Baubau on request, or it will be organised by your dive operator
