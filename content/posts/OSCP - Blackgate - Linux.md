# Blackgate
This is the first of the "Hard" machines I've tackled, so I'd been worried it may have been a major step up from what I'd been doing previously. Surprisingly though, this was very much a case of googling and learning about a service I'd never heard of (Redis), connecting to it to test a few commands, and then finding the version I was connected to had a well known RCE exploit and using it to achieve initial access!

Privilege escalation proved to be a bit more of a minefield though, mostly because I fixated on the fact the user had "run as root with no password" privileges for the same service I'd just abused to gain initial access - my first instinct was to try to learn more about Redis and potentially abuse the sudo privileges to achieve `root` access. 

In the end I ran `linpeas.sh` and identified that the target machine was vulnerable to `PwnKit`. Generally I've been ignoring the vulnerabilities `Linpeas.sh` recommends because they're often low-probability kernel exploits and are more effort to test than searching more something more obvious. In this case though, the PwnKit exploit I found is a super-simple one-liner, so I just ran it and got `root`!

The lesson here is to use what Linpeas is telling me, and not to be afraid of trying a kernel exploit if there's not a more obvious way to privilege escalate to root.

# Resolution summary
- Ran Nmap to identify ports `22` & `6379`
- Identified port `6379` as being associated with `redis`
- Researched `redis`, connected with netcat, and enumerated
- Identified `redis 4.0.14` and found RCE exploit
- Ran exploit and achieved reverse shell
- Enumerated target host & identified PwnKit vulnerability
- Ran exploit command, achieved `root` and printed `proof.txt`
## Improved skills
- Redis access and exploitation
- Privilege escalation with PwnKit vulnerability
## Used tools
- nmap
- python
- redis

# Information Gathering
Scanned all TCP ports:
```bash
sudo nmap -p- -T5 192.168.243.176 -v
sudo nmap -p 22,6379 -A 192.168.243.176 -v -oN Blackgate.nmap
```

Enumerated open TCP ports:
```bash
