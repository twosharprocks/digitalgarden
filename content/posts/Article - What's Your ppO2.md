There’s one thing watched by rebreather divers with greater concern above anything else - your partial pressure of oxygen, aka “ppO2”. No matter how extraordinary it feels breathing warm air with no bubbles, clearing deco far quicker than your open circuit buddies and drifting around gently to the sound of your own breath; it all comes at the cost of knowing the gas in your loop can quickly and easily become toxic if you’re not vigilantly watching your ppO2. If a solenoid sticks open or a manual add valve jams on, the flood of oxygen into the loop can drive your ppO2 over 1.60 and quickly lead to a hyperoxic convulsion that will ruin your whole day. On the flip side we need a ppO2 of about 0.18atm - equivalent to 18% oxygen on the surface - just to maintain regular brain function, and about 0.15 to maintain consciousness. And as I was brutally reminded earlier this year, ppO2 also happens to drop rather rapidly just as you approach the surface when you think the dive is over.

Every step of my first rebreather course was punctuated by my instructor reminding me to be constantly aware of how much oxygen was in the loop I was breathing from. During our first training dive it felt like he was being over-the-top with his near-constant signals that demanded to know “What’s your ppO2?” - couldn’t he clearly see what it was from my handset AND the HUD flashing bright green directly in my face? And besides, it’s not like it was often anything except 1.3 because my JJ was doing all the work for me - automatically squirting in a bit of O2 if the levels dropped a bit. If anything the solenoid was a bit of a pain because it would throw out my buoyancy by dumping O2 into the loop whenever I wanted to ascend!

I got a fairly rude wake-up call on my second training dive though. We dropped below the surface, ran a bubble check and cell test at 6m, signalled that everything was okay, then started to swim towards a small wreck at 12m. I kept trying to sort out my buoyancy as we swam (studiously checking my ppO2 on my handset every minute or so) when suddenly my HUD lit up like an angry Christmas tree. I glanced at my handset which was all red too, saying something about “BUS FAILURE” for a few seconds before going completely blank - something was definitely wrong. 

Besides “What’s your ppO2?” the other thing my JJ instructor had drilled into me was “If you can’t trust your loop, you need to get off it”. With no information coming from my oxygen cells to my handset or HUD there was absolutely no way to monitor what I was breathing, so I immediately bailed out. I swam up and tugged my instructor’s fin to show him the now completely blank handset - he instinctively signalled for me to bailout... then looked relieved when he realised I already had. We turned the dive and surfaced (giving me the opportunity to practice my first bailout ascent) then chatted about what had happened. As a brand new rebreather diver I didn’t know if this was a common issue and started to worry that I might not want to continue down this whole CCR pathway, but my instructor assured me that a complete electronics failure on a JJ was practically unheard of. Back in the workshop a quick look at the unit’s head showed there might have been an issue in the factory with the waterproof “potting” that protects the electronics, so the folks in Denmark quickly dispatched an entirely new head and we shipped the faulty one back. A few weeks later we were back in the water, and I finished the course without any further incidents.

The JJ-CCR is an extraordinary rebreather and it was the perfect introduction for someone like me shifting from back-mount twins to a rebreather. If I’d never taken the plunge into cave diving I’d almost certainly still be diving a JJ and absolutely loving it. The moment I finished my Basic Cave course in open-circuit sidemount though, it became crystal clear after over 20 years of ocean diving I’d finally found the niche I’d always been looking for. Unfortunately that wasn’t a niche that left much room for my JJ. The JJ-CCR is tough as nails, unbelievably reliable, and has been dived to more than 290 meters in the ocean… but fully loaded with cylinders and sorb it’s also half as heavy as I am! The moment I finished my CDAA Cave course I knew I’d lost any desire to go back in the ocean, and as soon as I tried using my JJ in places like Pines I realised the steel “cheese grater” that protects the unit’s head also has a nasty habit of gouging out chunks of limestone from the cave - the hunt was now on for a new, cave-friendly rebreather.

It didn't take long to find one. I’d read a lot about the KISS Sidewinder, heard podcasts about it, and one of my buddies from my Basic Cave course was now diving one and loving it. I liked what it seemed to offer and I knew a top-class instructor who trained on them too. So in early 2020 I sold my dearly-loved JJ-CCR and ordered my Sidewinder. The week before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, I had booked my unit crossover course with one CDAA instructor and locked in dates for my Advanced Cave course with another. It also happened to be the week my partner at the time rolled her car into a tree at 110km/hr. After 6 weeks in hospital, she was discharged to rehabilitate at home with me as her live-in carer for the rest of the year. 2020 was brutal for many of us, but the one thing that kept me together through it all was knowing I'd be moving permanently back to Mount Gambier as soon as she was independent again - the moment I was back in the Mount I'd finally be able to do the unit crossover & complete the AC course, and in no time I'd be exploring Tank cave on my shiny new Sidewinder!

Rubens took me through the unit crossover, and besides a few rigging issues on the first day the whole thing went incredibly smoothly. The Sidewinder is supremely easy to breathe, so I didn't notice a radical difference from diving sidemount or the JJ, except I felt like I was now getting the best of both! Sure, I no longer had any electronics providing overwatch on my ppO2, so I had to add my own O2 when it dipped. But to counteract that, my basic flashing HUD had been replaced with a NERD2 - providing ppO2 and everything else a technical dive computer does, and shoving it directly under my right eye as I dived. No way I'd forget to add O2 when it's literally centimetres from my face, right?

18 months after I'd been ready to do it, my Advanced Cave course finally rolled around. I was already a TDI Full Cave diver with about 100 hours of cave experience so I felt fairly prepared for the AC course, and given I’d had a couple of months on the Sidewinder I figured I'd be up for the challenge of doing it on my rebreather too - combining AC with TDI Full Cave CCR. What I didn't stop to think about was that I'd be doing AC on a rebreather and tacking on a hefty TDI course too, all while adjusting to owning my first home, running the active business that came with that home, and sorting out all the things that come from a breakup and an interstate move. I was stretched pretty thin, but I was used to pressure - I’d felt like I’d been trapped in a pressure cooker for all of 2020, and well before that everything I'd ever done with the military or for space-related projects had involved extraordinary levels of pressure too. 

So I started the course tired, but confident I’d manage everything that week above and below the waterline. And for the first 3 days of the AC course everything seemed fine. I was managing that outside pressure, felt comfortable and confident with the skills involved with the course, had readily taken feedback and immediately integrated it into my diving. I still felt bloody tired, but good about how everything was all going - I just needed to get to the end of Day 5 and get the course done.

We started Day 4 early at Pines, ready to finally enter the Advanced Cave areas and demonstrate skills we'd been polishing in Goulden's the days before. I geared up, waddled down the stairs, and then gently flopped backwards into the water trying to avoid disturbing the bottom near the last step. The moment I did, I heard an ominous "gulg" sound come from behind me, and immediately realised I'd left the rebreather loop behind my shoulders with the DSV open - the unit was flooding! I pulled the loop over my shoulder, closed it, checked the ppO2 was still safe, then reopened it to take a couple of test breaths to see if I'd stopped the flood in time. The counter-lung made a bubbling sound, the ppO2 went haywire, and I immediately closed the loop again - it was clear the unit was completely flooded.

The Advanced Cave course isn't the time to have an easily preventable equipment failure, and if I wanted that TDI certification I needed to fix the unit and get back in the water ASAP. Jon and Laurence were on the same course, so they went for their first dive with Rubens while I worked with another diver on-site to furiously dry out the canisters, counter-lung and those all-important oxygen sensors. The truly bizarre ppO2 readings on my NERD made it clear water had gotten into wiring between the O2 cells, so we focused our attention on drying the connections while changing the sorb and testing that nothing else had been damaged. An hour later the unit was back together and the O2 sensor readings had stabilised - just in time for Jon and Laurence to surface with Rubens. So I recalibrated the sensors, ran through my checklist again, and began my pre-breathe to kick off my first dive of the day two hours later than planned. 

That first dive was naturally intense but relatively uneventful in retrospect. I followed Rubens down to the Dark Room while repeating skills we’d done countless times already; before turning around and doing a bailout ascent while managing the reel and collecting a stage and a jump on our way out of the cave. During the dive I'd seen the ppO2 readings start to bounce around a little unpredictably, and suspected that the cold was causing condensation to form in the cell wiring again. At one point the variation between the cells was enough to briefly cause a voting error before the cells seemed to stabilse again - not a dive ending event, but certainly something to watch carefully during an already intense “almost end of the course” kind of dive. Just after that voting error I remember thinking "You’re doing fine here... but I'd probably have called this dive and gone home for the day if this wasn't my AC course". In retrospect I know I should have called it right then... but it was my AC course, and after so much waiting and effort I was determined to see it through to the end. We finished that dive safely, and surfaced without any other issues.

The second dive started an hour later in almost exactly the same way. I saw another voting error on descent, and really started to lose faith in the readings I was getting from the O2 sensors... but this was my last dive for the day, so that voice of caution was quickly silenced by my own overwhelming desire to "just get this done". I'd been waiting so long to do this course and it would open up so much if I could just keep it all together to the end of this dive. Besides, I'd have all afternoon to fully dry the unit and test the O2 cells before the relatively easy dives in Tank the next day! 

We headed down to the Wedge Room where Rubens made me turn off all my lights and then navigated back out of the cave in the dark. Working our way back passed the stop sign and up through the chimneys, we paused briefly at 4-6m to get everything in order before popping out into the main chamber where I’d collect my stage and the final jump spool. That little pause was the perfect opportunity to not just sort out my reel, but also to ensure my breathing loop was safe. But I didn't, and it wasn't. 

Focused on the course skills and now slightly distrustful of my cells, I hadn't been adding as much O2 to my loop during the dive: what if they were now wet and reading low, so adding too much led to a hyperoxic convulsion? The reality is I shouldn't have breathing from a loop I didn't fully trust, but if I’d stopped to think about it there was no physical way I could exceed a ppO2 of 1.6 anyway because I was back above 6m! But you're not thinking about that when you're already on the verge of hypoxia - you're just on autopilot and getting fuzzier by the second.

My last completely clear memory is unclipping my stage cylinder from the line at 4m. I have a hazy memory of clipping the stage on and struggling a little with the bottom clip, then following the line down to my jump spool, collecting it and the cookies at either end, before following the line back to about 2m where a reel had been tied from the surface. There's a very faint memory of untying the surface reel and having Rubens appear on my right-hand side to shake my hand for a dive well done, and then having him signalling "What's your ppO2?". The next thing I remember is sitting upright on the bench outside the cave, with the top half of my drysuit removed, and having someone I didn't recognise asking for my full name, address,  what day it was, if I knew where I was, and if I knew what had happened. What was clear was that something very bad had just happened, but I didn't know what it was.

About halfway through giving this unknown person my address, I realised they were probably trying to measure my GCS - the Glasgow Coma Scale that gets used to determine the consciousness level of someone who's in a coma or has suffered a brain injury. As I answered I looked down from their face, and realised I couldn't see anything except their t-shirt because my vision had narrowed to a tiny spot. My muddled hearing told me there was a LOT of people nearby even if I couldn't see them though, and over the next few minutes my awareness gradually opened enough for me to see an ambulance nearby as two paramedics brought a stretcher up to the bench. They asked me if I was okay to climb across and I was, and as they rolled me to the ambulance I saw someone I recognised and knew I had to apologise too. Was it Will, who supposed to be finishing his CDAA crossover course with Rubens immediately after my dive? Or was it Rubens, who I was sure I was just diving with? Whatever had happened and whoever I was apologising to, I knew I'd put a serious dent in their day.

My vision and hearing started to come back quickly in the ambulance, so much so that I gave a half-hearted attempt at flirting with the cute paramedic in the back - she repaid my efforts by smiling then stabbing me with a fluid line. By the time I was admitted to Mount Gambier hospital I was lively enough to crack jokes with the staff about falling asleep underwater, and all indications were that I’d be completely fine. My initial blood samples indicated I had elevated levels of an enzyme often associated with heart damage, but which also shows up after hypoxic events. No one thought I’d had a heart attack, but out of an abundance of caution the doctors decided to keep me for an extra few hours to make sure the enzyme levels dropped again to be certain it was "only" an underwater hypoxic blackout. It was 10 pm by the time the all-clear came back, so we all decided it'd be easier for me to stay in overnight.

I've got absolutely no memory of what happened that day in the 20 minutes between undoing the reel at 2 meters and then suddenly finding myself sitting on a bench answering questions with tunnel vision. But I do know a lot of really good people acted quickly to keep me breathing when I wasn't conscious enough to do it myself, and who made sure I didn't hurt myself or anyone else as I started to come around. I'll forever be grateful to Rubens for being the first to see something was wrong and immediately recognising it for what it was - his quick response and the actions of Pat and Helen (who surfaced right behind me) are almost certainly the reason I never completely stopped breathing, and why I never got water in my lungs. 

The call for help from the waterline was heard by eight CDAA divers in the Pines carpark, and all of them responded with everything they had. I’ll always be grateful to Danny, Shane, April, Andrew, Laurence, Jon and Burak for acting as quickly as they did to get an O2 reg in my mouth and using it to get me breathing properly again, for trying to help me as I lashed out in confusion when I started to come around, and for holding me steady as I walked up the stairs to the bench - I don’t remember any of it, but I’m thankful you were all there and I’m sorry you had to see me like that. I’ve been in your shoes trying to keep friends alive, and it’s almost always scarier and more damaging for the folks trying to help than it is for the person or people who need the help - thank you all for what you did.

One of the worst things I’ve ever had to do was to make a casualty evacuation call for a dying friend, so I’m especially aware of the impossible situation I placed Will in that day as he made the call to triple-0. Will had just parked when the call for help went out, but with no phone signal near where I was being given O2 he had to try and pass information to an emergency dispatcher without being able to get close enough to answer their questions about my situation. It also didn’t help that he had to somehow provide an address for a cave in the middle of a pine forest. As regular cave buddies we trust each other with our lives, but I’m sorry I tested it that day and especially sorry I delayed his final crossover dive!

Another of the worst things I’ve ever had to do was walk into an Emergency Department to see a partner after a near-fatal accident, so I’m grateful for the concerned but calm care that Chloe responded. As soon as Rubens contacted her she immediately jumped in the car and drove the 2.5 hours over from Horsham to see I was okay in person, stayed long after visiting hours ended, and used her own medical expertise to translate the discussion about those elevated enzymes for me. Before Chloe arrived, Rubens, Danny, and Will all managed to visit ED too and check I was okay - each helping me to understand what had happened in those critical 20 minutes I don’t remember. Laurence & Jon tried to visit too, but the ED nurses decided I’d already been turned into enough of a rockstar patient and wouldn’t let them exceed the visitor cap. 

It meant the world to walk out of Mount Gambier Hospital the next morning to be greeted by Chloe and Will carrying my soft toy wombat “Big Russ”. It’s also meant the world to have so many folks throughout the CDAA check-in to make sure I’ve been okay both physically and mentally in the weeks after it happened. The support from the directors in particular has been exceptional, and the entire experience made it clear to me just how tight-knit the small cave diving community in Australia is. Like any family, we grumble about each other at different times, and that can occasionally spill out into outright hostilities and feuds. But when someone is in real trouble, Aussie cave divers will drop everything to help any way they can. I’m immensely grateful to be part of a community of folks who not only pulled together to literally save my life that day, but have also encouraged me back in the water to finish my AC course... while also good-naturedly reminding me where the O2 button is on my rebreather! 

If there’s anything else to take away from this entire experience, it’s to slow down. Even with a couple of decades working, teaching and playing underwater, my circumstances above the waterline meant I was trying to do too much too soon, and I only narrowly avoided a permanent brain injury or death as a result. Cave diving and rebreathers are both amazing, but they’re also pretty unforgiving if you don’t do things properly - try to remember we’re all involved in an incredibly rewarding but slow-paced sport. There’s plenty to see at every stage of training, so take your time and enjoy it: call the dive if things don’t feel right, and no matter what you’re doing, keep asking “What’s my ppO2?”.
