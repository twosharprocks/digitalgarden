When I tell people I’ve just met that I’m a cave diver with claustrophobia, I always get a few confused looks followed by an inevitable round of questions along the lines of “Oh, so how do you stop the panic then?”. But when I mention my claustrophobia to people who know me and the kind of cave diving I do, the reaction is generally more like “You are very clearly broken, Josh - what is wrong with your brain?”.

I’ll admit that I have a bit of a reputation for squeezing into wet, muddy holes that most people are smart enough to avoid. And I’ll also admit that diving has always held a special place in my life - ever since I did my PADI Junior Open Water course at the age of 12, to teaching SCUBA and learning technical diving in my mid-20’s, to more recently recognising how the dark and the quiet of underwater caves play an important role in my mental health. In the last few years, I’ve also been struck by sections of the cave’s ceiling while pushing into a new underwater tunnel, broken two ribs trying to wriggle out of an underwater cave entrance, and spent an agonising 15 minutes trapped alone in a flattener during a total silt-out while trying to navigate a particularly vicious line-trap. But I’m still scared senseless by the mere thought of being stuck somewhere above the waterline. Go figure.

Joining CEGSA last year with a plan to start squeezing into tight dry holes felt like a natural development though. CEGSA offered the perfect opportunity to get involved with a huge part of cave exploration I’d previously dismissed, while also providing some much-needed experience that would inevitably help my underwater exploration too. I’ve been consistently trying to get involved with everything my new dry-caving friends are up to, from vertical access training to the Kelly Hill project on Kangaroo Island. But I’ve also been painfully aware I should start with a “beginners” cave trip before trying anything too adventurous. So when Leigh asked me “We’re organising a trip to Corra-Lynn for cave divers, are you interested?” I was a little surprised that instead of immediately blurting out “ABSOLUTELY” my first thought was “Ooooh… ummm… maybe?”.


There’s no question that cave divers and cavers are related but distinct breeds, and with three “cavers” and three “cave divers” in our group at Corra-Lynn, we quickly highlighted all of those similarities and differences. I knew before we left Adelaide that there’d be no hesitation from Chloe, Nino or myself when it came to climbing over rocks and shimmying through crevices underground - each of us has done exactly that countless times before with the added burden of scuba gear, all while searching for new cave diving sites or undiscovered tunnel in well-known ones. But the three of us “cave divers” have mostly experienced dry caving as an obstacle to overcome before getting in the water - how would we fare crawling around kilometres of underground passage and NOT get into the water? 

Our guides however were definitely “dry cavers” at heart. Matt and Leigh are two highly experienced cavers and climbers - they might be newer to the cave diving community, but they’ve already made a huge impression by applying their caving experience underwater. Meanwhile, Mark (aka Corby) has spent decades crawling around these dry and dirty labyrinths for fun without even trying to add diving to the mix. This trip would also turn out to be something of an initiation for Leigh - organising and leading a trip of his own, along with squeezing through a notorious pinch that the rest of his caving mates had all already done. I didn’t know it yet, but that pinch would also teach me more about caving and my own limits than I had expected to learn that day.

After meeting up at the Curramulka Bowls club and running through gear and ground rules, Leigh checked us all in with the landowner before we headed to the entrance to Corra-Lynn. Pulling on my coveralls, I got my first surprise of the day when I was handed a map and told I’d be leading the start of our trip underground - apparently my nickname “Wombat” meant I was automatically obliged to guide the group through “The Wombat Runs” near Corra-Lynn’s entrance! Flicking through the half-dozen pages of the cave map on the surface felt a bit daunting, and that feeling only got worse when I realised what Leigh meant by Corra-Lynn being “multi-level” - I’d be jumping back and forth between different pages of the maps as we climbed up and dropped down through the various layers of the cave! 

Multi-level maps were one thing, but the real adjustment for the cave divers among us was understanding the scale and detail of the maps themselves. With no limits for breathing gas or time, dry cave maps can be significantly more detailed than what we usually see on underwater caves, so it took me nearly half an hour (and half a dozen wrong turns) before I started to realise that “small” features on a dry cave map mean REALLY small. As in “No Josh, it’s solid rock too tight to even get your head into, let alone the rest of your body” small, as opposed to a “small” feature on an underwater cave map usually meaning “A smarter person wouldn’t even consider this, but if I press my head into the silt hard enough I might pop out into a massive new tunnel!”. I’ve extended the maps for a few different places underwater, but it only took 20 minutes in Corra-Lynn to realise that if a caver says a dry section of cave “doesn’t go”, then it damn well doesn’t go!

It also might seem odd to dry cavers, but heading into the darkness without a line back to the surface felt supremely wrong for a cave diver who’s had the golden rule “Always use a continuous guideline to the surface” drilled into him. Some of the biggest scares I’ve ever had underwater came from drifting just a few meters away from the guideline, and turning around to find that lifeline has disappeared in a thick cloud of silt. So my question “How do you find your way out if you get lost?” to Matt was well-meaning, but I also probably deserved his laughing “With the map!” response. The problem is generally cave divers only look at a map on the surface, well before we get in the water - we use wall maps to write up a dive plan, noting on a wrist slate which way to turn at each of the numbered line junctions (eg. “Left @ A3”) to reach our destination. And underwater we just follow the directions on our wrist slate, placing a personalised “dive cookie” or a clothes peg on the line near each junction so we can just follow the line and our cookies back out of the cave when we turn for home.

Once I got my head around the relative size of the map features and that it was perfectly okay to just use the map without any line or cookies to guide our way home because we weren’t going to run out of air in a dry cave, then navigating into Corra-Lynn turned out to be relatively straightforward. We had a minor scare when I tried to climb through a roof portal and took a bit of a tumble back to the bottom again, but otherwise we navigated uneventfully through the Wombat Runs, down Skeleton Crevasse and Skeleton Maze, into Walrus Room, and to the bottom of the cave near Hawaiian Tub Pit. 

Matt, Leigh and Corby’s memory around the Hawaiian Tub Pit was starting to get hazy, so Nino and I started scouting ahead to figure out exactly where we were. It was during one of these forward scouts that I first realised cavers regularly challenge themselves to squeeze through tight sections just for fun… even when there’s a perfectly reasonable and easier way around the restriction. Now I’m all for sneaky shortcuts when I’m cave diving - if I can get to F5 in Tank Cave 20 minutes faster by wriggling through the silty flattener at L5 instead of swimming the “normal way” via F1, then that’s 20 minutes extra gas to breathe when we’re poking around at the back of the cave. But I can’t say I’ve ever really understood the appeal of squeezing through something tight when there’s an easier and safer alternative right next to it. 

The Hawaiian Tub Pit offered just such a challenge though - a crawl 20m through a small but gentle tunnel going “the long way round”, or laying on your back and wriggling upside-down through a 1.5m long fissure before trying to squeeze your face under a low-hanging ceiling rock. I took one look at the fissure and my stomach lurched as a clear reminder that I really am claustrophobic - I just forget sometimes. Nino and I started around the 20m tunnel as the others caught up, and Leigh soon joined us going around the “long way”. By the time Chloe, Matt and Corby reached the Hawaiian Tub Pit; Nino, Leigh and I had reached the other side of the fissure and we could all chat to each other through it. 

There was no way I was attempting the squeeze from either direction, but Nino decided to see if he could take the shortcut back to the Hawaiian Tub Pit. Laying face-up and his head down into the bottom of the squeeze, Nino started to press his face under the low-hanging ceiling rock and soon went “Nooooope!” before shuffling back out of the hole.

Leigh fared a little better, but still finding his face would need a few extra millimetres of flexibility to get passed the tightest point. The other side of the fissure offered a slightly easier entry, but at the expense of having further to wriggle before reaching the tightest point. Corby wriggled in upside-down and slid straight to the tightest point just centimetres from our side, but like Leigh he just couldn’t get any under the low-hanging ceiling rock without gouging a hole in his face.

Watching our most experienced guide wriggle upside-down inside a tiny fissure hundreds of meters underground, I started to feel a rising sense of dread that only got worse as Corby got temporarily stuck reversing out… and I soon started to wonder if I was cut out for this whole “dry caving for fun” thing. We’d had a great couple of hours climbing and sliding through mud, wriggling through tunnels, and navigating up and down through holes had turned out to be a lot of fun. But now reached the bottom and squeezed into a few things, so now I was very ready to start heading back out and home.

Heading home involved a few detours I hadn’t fully understood though. Climbing down Skeleton crevasse had been a little bit hair-raising, and the group didn’t feel confident climbing back up it - we’d be taking a different path to the surface along the “Bandicoot Bypass”. We also needed to pass via the Wedding Cake formation so Leigh could do his “guide initiation” by squeezing through a notoriously tight pinch nearby. And it turned out both “detours” were a little more than my tired cave diver bones were quite ready.

From the main tunnel, the squeeze looks tight but only at one very specific point - provided you could flatten yourself out at that one pinch, it didn’t look too panic-inducing. The squeeze is one-way though and needs to be entered from a roof fissure in a nearby side tunnel, so Corby provided tunnel support as Leigh climbed up through the rock fissure and the rest of us watched from the main tunnel. Leigh made his way around to the squeeze, lay on his back, tucked his chest at the tightest point, and popped through without much hassle at all! 

Nino had already decided he wanted to give it a go, and I figured there’d be no harm in trying too - if Leigh could make it look that easy, then I’m sure I could struggle my way through! Corby warned us before climbing up the roof fissure that it wasn’t safe to come back the same way though, and my tired brain interpreted that as “If you climb up you’ll have to get through the pinch” - never once thinking there might have been other ways down from the roof space. 

Without a second thought, Nino gracefully hauled himself up the roof fissure with his long arms and legs. I followed by flapping my stubby little limbs around before finding a way to leverage myself up too. Mimicking Leigh’s earlier demonstration, Nino laid on his back, slithered up to the squeeze, tucked himself under the tightest point, and popped out the other side just seconds later. “This thing should be fairly easy!” was the woefully naive thought that crossed my mind as I also laid down, slithered up to the squeeze, tucked myself under the tightest point… and promptly got stuck.

The worst part was looking up into all the open space where my friends were standing in a gaping tunnel, and yet this very pointy piece of rock was pushing hard into my chest and pinning me in place. I tried to take a few slow breaths, but immediately felt a wave of panic building as the rock was also restricting my breathing. I managed to wheeze out “I might be in a bit of trouble here guys” and Nino reached to grab my outstretched hand and pull me through, but Corby stopped him - I wasn’t going to die where I was (even if my brain was screaming otherwise) and the only safe way to get in or out of the pinch was to do it under my own steam. 

Matt quickly ducked into the side tunnel and climbed up the roof fissure to provide support behind me, and I laid still to calm myself before wriggling back just enough to breathe properly again. That’s when I realised it wasn’t my ribs that had stopped me getting through - it was the compass I’d had slung around my neck! Backing fully out of the squeeze I sat up, tucked my compass into a pocket and laid back again, ready for another attempt… and immediately felt an overwhelming sense of dread at the mere thought. 

Laying there, I looked at everyone else on the other side of the pinch and tried to summon the will to squeeze in again, but even with all the group’s encouragement and the compass off my chest, I just wasn’t convinced I’d be able to get through. I pulled back out of the squeeze and sat with Matt, silently thinking “Great, now I’m stuck here because we can’t climb down the roof fissure” when Matt said something revolutionary: “There’s no pressure to do this mate, we can just back out if you’re not feeling it”. 

Wait, “back out”? I thought there was no way out of the roof space except through the pinch or dropping dangerously through the fissure! Matt said “Nah, there’s 5 or 6 easier ways back to the tunnel from here”, to which I instantly laughed “Well *** this pinch business then - get me out of here!”. Matt led me back to the roof fissure and up into another tunnel I’d not seen before, around a couple of bends, and minutes later we were back with the rest of the group. There’s no doubt I was a bit shaken, but I wasn’t hurt or embarrassed about backing out - just a little confused why I’d watched Leigh squeeze through the pinch in the first place and thought “You know what, I’m going to try that too!”.

We set off for the surface, and within a few minutes the adrenaline of the experience faded away and I suddenly felt very wiped out from the day’s activities. But we weren’t far now - we just needed to get into Bandicoot Bypass and follow it almost all the way back to the entrance, where I could step back into glorious daylight again! The only obstacle on our way? The fact that “Bandicoot Bypass” is a low, 40-meter-long crawl done mostly on your side because it’s barely wide enough for your helmet to fit through. Apparently, it’s well known for reducing a lot of young Scouts to tears, and truth be told it nearly did the same to me.

Crawling through Bandicoot Bypass involved a lot of what I’d call “elevated but managed” stress. I’d well and truly had enough of this cave by this point, and was just doing whatever needed to be done to reach the point where I was not underground anymore. So for the first 15 to 20 meters, I was managing just fine - lift sideways, pull myself forward, drag the gear bag up behind me, pause for a breath, and repeat. 5-10 meters ahead was Nino, sliding through on his side just as I was and providing a visual indication of any tight spots before I reached them. And I could hear Chloe behind me, quietly soldiering on through the tunnel and seeming to enjoy herself without any real concerns.

Near the start of Bandicoot Bypass.

There was a convoy of us in this fairly dusty tunnel, and if one person stopped then it blocked everyone behind them. Likewise, if someone behind you got into trouble there’d be no way to turn around to help or wriggle over them to escape. I suddenly realised we were all passing through a long, thin tube of rock with no way out if the people ahead and behind me stopped. There was no way to tell how close Nino was to the end of the tunnel, and the sounds of Chloe behind me just seemed to be getting progressively louder and closer. 

I started to get a bit overwhelmed by it all, and called back to Chloe to pause for a minute to give me some space… when suddenly Nino stopped and called back to check if there was a problem. Suddenly all my lizard brain could focus on was that the body in front of me wasn’t moving forward anymore, so I yelled to Nino “Don’t stop! Please just keep moving!”. Chloe paused behind me to provide some space, then carefully asked “Are you okay?” to which I replied “No, not really. But we’re all just going to keep going and get through this”. 

After another few minutes of shuffling, wheezing and twisting to look ahead, I noticed a light shining back over Nino’s shoulder - Leigh had cleared the Bandicoot Bypass and was now looking down it towards us! Within a few metres, Nino had stopped dragging himself on his side, and then two lights shone back as they both looked down Bandicoot Bypass to me. A few seconds later I found myself back on two knees as I cleared the end Bandicoot Bypass as well, and sighed with relief. I paused briefly to look back down Bandicoot Bypass to where Chloe was cheerfully shuffling her way through, and realised she was 12 to 15 metres back even though it had felt like she’d been right on my tail the entire way!

Once we were all through Bandicoot Bypass we re-grouped in Grand Central, and for the first time I saw cave arrows on the walls - proof that these dry cavers do occasionally use markers to point the way out! The others wanted to admire and climb around the sculpted rock of Grand Central, but all I wanted was to not be underground anymore. A few more twists and turns through some relatively open tunnels, and we were suddenly greeted by honest-to-goodness daylight.

Finally, natural light!

We’d carried lunch underground but hadn’t eaten it, so as soon as we were back at the cars we hooked into the now squished sandwiches. Matt, Leigh and Corby immediately started talking about heading back into the cave after lunch, and with a mouthful of ham and cheese I informed them they’d be doing that without me - I absolutely was done for the day, and would gladly sit in the car and nap while they ventured back in. Nino and Chloe both seemed keen for a second round though, so they geared back up and headed off. 

I’d barely closed my eyes in the front seat of the car before Chloe was back too though - she’d been keen for a “quick look” at a different part of the cave, but bailed when she realised Matt, Leigh and Corby were planning to be gone for another couple of hours. Nino stuck with the group though, but I think even he was running out of steam by the time the four of them reached their destination underground!

No trip to Corra-Lynn cave would be complete without a parmigiana at the Curramulka Hotel, so with everyone on the surface and most of the mud brushed off, we headed into town for the biggest “kid-size” crumbed-chicken monstrosities I’ve ever seen. We were all a bit wiped, Chloe was already starting to show enough bruises to convince people she’d been cage-fighting for the last month, and none of us were looking forward to the drive back to Adelaide in the dark… but we all agreed it had been worth it for such an amazing day out.

After everything, would I do it again? Probably, but only if there was something to explore or record. There’s no question that I love caves, and I have no hesitation squeezing into places if I know it’ll get me somewhere I want to see, or pushing on if it’ll get me back to the surface again. But the pinches near the Hawaiian Tub Pit and the Wedding Cake made it very clear that I am not interested in squeezing into things when there’s an easier, less claustrophobic option, and I’m certainly not going to be squeezing into anything I’m not absolutely certain I can get back out of. 

Dry caving still feels like “a thing I’ll do to start or continue a cave dive” and I’m not sure if that’s ever going to change. But it doesn’t mean I’ll say no if someone invites me on a purely dry-caving expedition. Check a lead that someone spotted but didn’t wriggle into? Absolutely! Look for holes that were surveyed in the 80’s but haven’t been seen since? Sign me up! But if our trip to Corra-Lynn taught me one thing, it’s that I’m going to need a little more incentive than “we’ll climb some rocks and maybe squeeze through some tight stuff” to crawl into another dry cave in the future!
