**Cryptography** is the art and science of keeping information secure through the use of mathematical concepts and techniques.
Goals of Cryptography - P.A.I.N.
* **Privacy** (Confidentiality) keeps data secure from unauthorized parties
* **Authentication** is used to confirm the identities of the sender and receiver of data.
* **Integrity** ensures a message isn’t altered in transit
* **Non-Repudiation** prevents the original sender from denying they were the sender.

## OpenSSL
* `openssl` Initializes the OpenSSL program.
* `enc` Stands for “encryption.”
* `-pbkdf2` Specifies the encryption key type.
* `-nosalt` Specifies that salting will not be applied.
* `-aes-256-cbc` Is the name of the cipher used
* `-K` KEY Defines the encryption key (“KEY” is the key)
* `-iv` INITIAL Defines the initialisation vector (IV) (“INITIAL” is the IV)
* `-P > key_iv.txt` Prints the key and IV to “key_iv.txt”
* Creating a key and IV: `openssl enc -pbkdf2 -nosalt -aes-256-cbc -k mypassword -P > key_and_IV.txt`
* Encrypting: `openssl enc -pbkdf2 -nosalt -aes-256-cbc -in plaintextmsg.txt -out encodedmsg.txt.enc -base64 -K KEY_HERE -iv IV_HERE`
* Decrypting: `openssl enc -pbkdf2 -nosalt -aes-256-cbc -in encodedmsg.txt.enc -d -base64 -K KEY_HERE -iv IV_HERE`

* List Public GPG keys on the system: `gpg --list-keys`
* List Secret GPG keys on the system: `gpg --list-secret-keys`
* Edit key with adduid, trust, deluid and save: `gpg --edit-key <targetemail>`
* Delete Public Key of UID (or Public Key listed): `gpg --delete-key <UID or Public Key>`
* Delete Secret Key of UID (or Public Key listed): `gpg --delete-secret-key <UID or Public Key>`
* Import someone’s Public Key: `gpg --import <targetname>.gpg`
* Export your Public Key: `gpg --output <yourname>.gpg --export <youremail>`
* Decrypt yourmsg.txt sent by someone using your Public key: `gpg --decrypt yourmsg.txt`
* Create encrypted secret.txt.enc for target using their Public key and message.txt: `gpg --output secret.txt.enc --encrypt --recipient <target> msg.txt`
* Sign a file with GPG for verification (creates file yourmsg.txt.gpg_): `gpg --sign yourmsg.txt`
* Specifies default key if you have multiple keys on the system: `--default-key`
* Verify the signature of the document: `gpg --verify yourmsg.txt.gpg`
* Decrypt signed document: `gpg --output yourmsg.txt --decrypt yourmsg.txt.gpg`
* Wrap file with ASCII-armored signature (no file modification): `gpg --clearsign yourmsg.txt`
* Create a detached signature with signed file: `gpg --output Signed.sig --detach-sig yourmsg.txt` 
## Hashing
**Hashing** is a cryptographic method used to verify the integrity of data. It is also a way of storing password data without storing the passwords in plaintext.

## Digital Forensics
**Forensic examiner** is a cybersecurity professional who captures and investigates digital evidence from computers, cell phones, and other devices containing digital data.
* Forensic examiners make a hash of a device when it is initially collected for investigation. This hash can be later used to verify that the digital data was not modified during the investigation.
**Steganography** is the cryptographic technique of placing hidden messages within files, images, or videos.
### Using Steghide
`steghide embed –ef alpha.txt –cf image.jpeg` embed alpha.txt into image.jpeg
`steghide extract –sf image.jpeg` extract embedded message from image.jpeg
## Cryptographic Attacks
**Statistical Attack** exploits weakness in cryptographic algorithms by attempting to determine if the “random” values produced are actually predictable. 
**Frequency analysis** is a method for cracking substitution algorithms in a statistical attack.
**Brute Force Attack** involves attackers using many passwords or user and password combinations until one eventually works.
**Birthday Attack** exploits the probability that two separate plaintexts that use the same hash algorithm will produce the same ciphertext (aka **collision** and **hashing collision**)

* [Merkle–Damgård construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle%E2%80%93Damg%C3%A5rd_construction) [Wikipedia]
**Replay Attack** involves an attacker intercepting an encrypted message and replaying it to the receiving party to get access. (eg. detecting a car’s remote locking & rebroadcasting it)
**Rainbow tables** are resources that contain precomputed hashes with the associated plaintext passwords. Mitigated by salting stored hashes.
