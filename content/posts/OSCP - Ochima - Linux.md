# Ochima
This one was an exercise in frustration purely because the exploit didn't seem to work on the port I wanted it to (`4444`) but *would* work on port `80`!? 

I tired all sorts of things to get it work, the walkthroughs didn't explain why they used port 80, and the exploit itself indicated it'd work on whatever I picked... but the moment I popped port 80 into the exploit's reverse shell parameters I got an incoming connection. So an important reminder that if a reverse shell isn't working on port `4444` then try the same thing but with a listener on port `80` instead

Once I had initial access, privilege escalation wasn't hugely complicated - I spotted the `.tar` backup file pretty quickly, and after running `linpeas.sh` I saw the `etc_Backups.sh` script too. Part of me worried that I'd need to find a way to execute the script if it wasn't scheduled, or that I wouldn't have write access, but after checking with `ls -lah` I saw it was wide open, and I could have uploaded `pspy` to see if it was running too.

All round a bit frustrating to lean on a walkthrough to figure out initial access, but the walkthrough didn't help much anyway - it just told me the exploit *could* work, and it took me realising the walkthroughs both happened to use port 80 before I tried it myself.

**Note**: My initial `nmap` scan didn't show up port `8338`, so this was an important reminder to run a wider and more aggressive scan if there's no obvious way forward (or just start by running `sudo nmap -p- -T5 192.168.xx.xxx -v` followed by an aggressive port specific scan)

**Note2**: Don't forget to scan UDP if the TCP scan doesn't show much - most of the time you'll find nothing, but if you do it'll be a big deal.
# Resolution summary
- Ran Nmap to identify ports `22` & `8080`
- Visited http (`8090`) & identified `Confluence v7.13.6`
- Identified exploit for CVE-2022-26134 and ran against target for reverse shell
- Uploaded `pspy` and identified `log-backup.sh` being run regularly by `root`
- Added command to change `/bin/bash` SUID and waited for script to run
- Ran `/bin/bash -p` to become `root`
## Improved skills
- Linux Privilege Escalation
- Handling reverse shells
## Used tools
- nmap
- python
- linpeas.sh
