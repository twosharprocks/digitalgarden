"Fear is the mind killer" is the most easily recognised line from the "Litany Against Fear" from the Dune universe. Recited by high-born characters in times of high stress or when death threatens, it acts to centre and stabilise the emotions of those who recited it through the application of cold logic. 

Accepting fear and allowing it to pass over you is vital to remaining in control when it could take control of your mind. In the universe of Dune, the litany is adopted as a vaccine to a digital virus that feeds on fear. However it's origin can be traced back to Act II of Shakespeare's *Julius Caesar*, in a quote which has been adapted numerous times - most notably paraphrased as "A coward dies a thousand deaths, but the brave die only once". 

Fear is seen as a powerful but ephemeral emotion, and with the tools provided by a logical mind it is possible to accept the emotion without giving in to it and being overwhelmed. Fear, like joy or despair, is a natural emotion felt in response to a threat to our body, mind, or loved ones. Fear can be an excellent motivator, but giving in to fear allows it to eat up our mental faculties and reduce us to a whimpering mass. Far better to face a fear when you feel it, to allow it to pass over you like any other emotion, and realise that once it's gone only you will be left behind to think, act, and move forward.

The Litany Against Fear is a unique addition to the Dune universe, drawing from and inspiring many other sources but still carving out a distinct fragment of lore within the book series. It is an acknowledgement of death and the fear associated with it, and provides those who recite it as a way to release the debilitating effects of fear by facing it head-on.

> The valiant never taste of death but once.  
> Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,  
> It seems to me most strange that men should fear,  
> Seeing that death, a necessary end,  
> Will come when it will come.
