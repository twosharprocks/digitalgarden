# Easy wins
- Linux: Capabilities, SUIDs/GUIDs, cronjobs, modifiable binaries running as root, out-of-date binaries, known-binary exploits, history files.
- Windows: Weak service permissions, Unquoted service paths, outdated binaries, scheduled tasks, custom 
- Take breaks, and set timers: If you're not getting anywhere for more than half an hour, take a break. Get some fresh air, and you'll almost definitely think of a new idea. 
	- Similarly, celebrate when you make progress! If you finish a machine its a good time for a rest
- Regularly review the information you have for a machine - key services, known version numbers, and any known credentials. 
- Document as you go - take screenshots of key moments in the machine, and of course when you read a proof file.
- Metasploit - pick the machine that you think you have the least chance of exploiting manually

## Things I Wish I'd Done
- Downloaded the various resources from the dedicated lab clients; 
- Document for your report as you go during the exam
- Do a practice exam!
