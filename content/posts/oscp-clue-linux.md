# Clue
This was definitely a hard box, but the biggest challenges came from the range of different services AND the box itself not working properly. After a couple of hours bashing my head against the brick wall trying to get initial access, I finally relented and looked at a walkthrough... only to find that the `cassandra` exploit I'd tried to use to display files on the target hadn't worked because the box needed to be reverted.

There's no doubt I'd have gotten there in the end, but there was a LOT of enumeration required to get the passwords, and the SMB shares threw me for quite awhile initially to. Finding the correct files to enumerate could have taken hours more had I not used the walkthrough, but at the same time I was so tired (and pissed off) by the box being broken that I wasn't reading the help files properly to see the clues that would have led me to `/proc/self/cmdline` and `event_socket.conf.xml` sooner. All round a tough box with a few good lessons... made tougher by being broken until I reverted it.

# Resolution summary
- Ran Nmap to identify ports `22`, `80`, `139`, `445`, `3000` & `8021`
- Identified port `3000` as running `Cassandra`
- Identified port `8021` as running `freeswitch`
- Found exploit for `cassandra` that allowed reading `/proc/self/cmdline` which included credentials for `cassie`
- Reused same exploit to read `freeswitch` config file `/etc/freeswitch/autoload_configs/event_socket.conf.xml` which included password for `freeswitch`.
- Found exploit for `freeswitch`, modified exploit to use found password, and achieved initial access.
- Enumerated target host to identify users and sudo privileges
- Used `sudo` privileges of `cassie` to launch internal `cassandra` server and provide `root` access to target system. 
- Checked `.bash_history` of `anthony` and identified `root`'s SSH key copied to `/home/anthony/.ssh/`
- Saved `root` SSH key to local system, then used it to login as `root` via SSH
- Navigated to `/root` and printed proof file
## Improved skills
