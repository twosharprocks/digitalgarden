# Pelican
Pretty happy with this one considering I figured most of it out without really looking at a walkthrough. Identifying Exhibition vs Zookeeper was a little confusing, but as soon as I identified that Exhibition v1.0 was vulenerable to command injection then finding & using an exploit (which was really just adding a reverse shell to a java script field) became fairly straightforward. 

Privilege escalation with `gcore` was a little tricky, as it's been awhile since I needed to remember how `strings` worked. But once it became clear I could search for plaintext passwords then it made sense and switching to root was easy.

# Resolution summary
- Used Nmap to id a series of open port, notably 8080 & 8081 (HTTP)
- Identified vulnerable service (Exhibition v1.0)
- Added reverse shell to javascript field in admin console and gained initial access
- Searched for sudo privileges, identified `charles` user could run `gcore`
- Ran `gcore` as sudo against `password-store` binary and saved output
- Searched output file for strings, identified credentials for root
- Switched user to root
## Improved skills
- Linux enumeration
- Linux privilege escalation
## Used tools
- Nmap
- Searchsploit
