With just three months away, it's suddenly becoming a big and urgent question of what you want to do before you're 40, and more importantly what kind of life you want to live in your 40's. You never really thought you'd make it to 30, and yet here you are nearly 10 years later wondering what you want to do next.

You 40s really need to be about embracing the life you want to live and reinforcing those things you love most. There's no question you love writing books on your own, thinking deeply about difficult things, and sharing experiences with others who would never do see what you see without you. Your 40s should be about being bolder in the things you excel at, and cutting free the things that drag. All the philosophy you want to live by is already within you, already hashed out in your notes - now if the time to live it fully. 

So what do you want to do before your 40? Shed the dead-weight. That's physically losing weight and being fitter, shedding mental loads by organising yourself with a Knowledge-Management system, cutting free the emotional bonds that drag on you, and setting yourself free spiritually too. Writing a mini essay about the Mini Essay - Physical Baggage, Mini Essay - 5 - Mental Baggage, Mini Essay - Emotional Baggage, and Mini Essay - Spiritual Baggage weight you want to shed will help you a lot too. Look at what's holding you back and weighing you down, and cut it free - that's the way you'll dig your way out of this current slump. Do less, expect less, push less... and it will free you to be who you want to be.
