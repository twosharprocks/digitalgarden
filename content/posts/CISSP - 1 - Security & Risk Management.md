Import and Export Controls
- Wassenaar Arrangement
	- 42 countries agreeing not to distribute weapons & cryptographic tools
	- Some states have outright bans on the import of cryptographic technologies (often about preventing challenges to government authority)

Program Effectiveness Evaluation
- Due care requires effective ***education, training, and awareness*** for employees
- Due diligence requires ***evaluation*** of the effectiveness of that training
- Ask the right questions: Purpose of an awareness program is to enable and empower all organisation members to achieve safer, more secure and more compliant actions when using information
	- Do your workers have the tools, processes, and procedures to do this?
	- Do they know how to use then effectively
	- Do they have the resource have have what they need to deal with the unexpected
- User Participation
	- List of training outcomes, then test participants, audits, spot checks	
- Social Engineering response
	- Mock attack attempts to determine if personnel respond appropriately	
- Log Reviews
	- Review user activity to determine if it's compliant with policies

Education, Training, and Awareness
- Education: Learning activity focused on cause and effect
- Training: Building proficiency in a specific set of skills or actions.
- Awareness: Activities that attract and engage learner attention. Alerting users to new/novel attacks, help shape behaviour

Organisational Processes
- Each organisation will determine it's own decision-making process
- Some use a governance body/committee (most non-profits use this)
- Organisational decisions that may impact security;
	- Acquisition - Extensive security implications
	- Merger - Requires alignment
	- Divestiture - Determine who owns proprietary data

Candidate Screening & Hire
- Focus on Minimising Insider Threat

Privacy Policy Requirements (PII Access)
- Similar to AUP - Stipulate what is classed as PII, handling procedures, how user is expected to comply, enforcement/punitive measures, references to relevant regulations. 

Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad)
- Assets are data that require security (electronic or otherwise)
- Confidentiality: Only authorised entities have access (eg. A lock on a safe)
- Integrity: No unauthorised modification of data (eg. version control on a document)
- Availability: Authorised entities can access data when they're permitted to do so (eg. Keeping easily accessible backups of data)

Organisational Roles and Responsibilities
- Senior Management (CEO/COO/CIO/CSO/CTO/CFO, ect)
- Security manager/officer/director (Senior security person in org)
	- Security manager should not report to IT department
- Security personnel - Security practitioners in org
- Administrators/Technicians
	- Sys admins, network engineers
- Users

*Case Study: 1MDB*
**1. What would be a driver for the fraud?** Opportunistic theft from a large multilateral investment.
**2. How likely was it to happen?** The opportunity for fraud existed, which likely resulted in fraud.
**3. Who should have been providing the oversight?** 1MDB fund management should have been providing oversight.
**4. How could it have been prevented?** There should have been more effective oversight enacted collectively by the investors, fund managers, and Malaysian authorities.

On the surface, this was a positive, even aspirational endeavor. But ultimately, it was doomed to failure. Ethics, like everything else, must be included in our policies and procedures, and the ethics committee must vigilantly review and monitor. You, as a security professional, are there to set the example. What you say and do will, in fact, become the new practice.

## Legal Environment
Latin America
- Argentina, Brazil, Chile, & Colombia all have various implementations of data protection/privacy legislation in force or in development
- Latin America, North Africa & medium-size Asian enterprises are mostly influenced by EU data protection/privacy laws

Privacy: Concepts Continually and Rapidly Evolve
- Frequent legislative change (Privacy laws in India, China, Brail, and California CCPA2018)
- Privacy concerns will continue to grow and privacy will evolve

Privacy and E-Discovery in US Law
- "Electronic discovery" where electronic data is sought, located, secured and searched with the intent of use as evidence in civil/criminal case
- Fourth amendment protects against unreasonable search & seizure (but not against all search & seize, only those deemed unreasonable)
	- Restricts governments can do to obtain information, but no restriction on private organisations can do with information they own/control/possess/use 
		- Free to establish own fair use policies
		- Free to provide copies of info to government under any circumstance it deems fit (eg. court order)
- USA PATRIOT ACT
	- Extended government powers of search and seizure - allow National Security Letters (NSL) to be written and served on anyone without court order, subpoena or search warrant
	- Also prohibits orgs from disclosing they have been served with an NSL or other discovery motion,
	- Shifted balance towards greater security at cost of personal privacy
- Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights & California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

Privacy Protection
- Protect while collected, used, processed, archived, and destroyed
- General Data Protection Regulation (2018) - Throughout EU & European Economic Area
	- Many US businesses found it prudent (but not necessary) to update business processes to be GDPR-compliant

European Union
- Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) established privacy protection guidelines and standards
- Decisions by national courts and World Intellectual Property Organisation's tribunal amplified and made binding by EU Directive 2002/58/EC (ePrivacy Directive) 
- GDPR - 25 May 2018 - Binding on any entity that does e-business with those within the EU and EEA

Licencing and Intellectual Property Requirements
- Site licencing: Org purchases right to use software for all members of org staff
- Per-seat licencing: Org purchases a specific number of copies of software, or pays a certain price (usually below retail) for every copy used
- Shareware: Generally creative commons
- Public charter: Software use is free as is modification and customisation but tech support or extra features are paid
- Security team becomes defacto software library to manage software licencing

The United States
- Many sector specific privacy and data security laws at federal and state levels (Privacy is "sectorial" in US)

Data Portability
- Allows individuals the right/ability to move data from one service to another. 
- Article 20 of GDPR defines circumstances that a data subject may have a right to request their data.

Right to Be Forgotten (EU Law as part of GDPR 2018)
- Allows anyone in the EU and EEA to request personal data about them be deleted
- Argentina, Brazil, South Korea and India have their own versions
- China does NOT have a "right to be forgotten" law
- May conflict with other legitimate legal processes

## Understand and Apply Security Concepts
Due Care and Due Diligence - Demonstrate Due Care by conducting Due Diligence
- Due Care: Legal concept - duty owed from organisation to it's customers (eg. car manufacturer building a safe car)
- Due Diligence: Any activity used to demonstrate or provide due car (eg. production line quality control, external auditing, ect)

Special Circumstances in Screening and Hiring
- Responsibility of the employer to use good judgement and due diligence when making decisions in these instances

Onboarding, Transfers, and Termination Processes
- Onboarding should include contract terms review, initial training, signing NDA, and secure process for access to sensitive info
- Termination should lock IT accounts, recover property, exit interview, review of NDA terms, employee escorted from premises

Compliance Policy Requirements
- Organisations should use Acceptable Use Policies (AUPS) for all personnel
- Policy aspects commonly include: Passwords, Data retention, Internet Usage, Data Access, System Access, Data Disclosure, Company Device Usage

Minimum Security Requirements
- Created for every level - level of acceptable risk
- Every netwok, every system in network, and every component
- Also project management
- Gathering Minimum Security Rerquirements
	- Involve stakeholders
	- Requirements are specific, realistic and measurable
	- Record and document all elements of discussion and outcome
	- Restate your understanding of customer input
	- Don't choose tools or solutions until requirements are understood
		- Business function drives tools and functionality

# Control Selection (Security and Privacy)

Privacy Frameworks
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- OECD Privacy Principles - GDPR ancestor
- Privacy Management Framework (PMF) - 2009 revision of Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP) by AICPA (US Accountants)

Service Level Requirements
- Set of minimum performance & support requirements
- Service Level Agreement (SLA) - Discrete, numeric metrics to measure compliance
	- Best for recurring services (rather than disaster response)

Third Party Assessments and Monitoring
- Governance Review, Formal Security Audit, Site Security Survey, Penetration Testing
- Standards
	- AICPA SSAE 16 SOC reports (SOC 1,2,3 reports - linked to Sarbanes-Oxley Act, SOX)
	- CSA STAR Evaluation: Cloud Security Alliance
	- ISO-certified audits

Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
- Determine value of each asset belonging to the organisation, the potential risk of losing assets, threats likely to affect the organisation, and the potential for common threats to be realised.
- Also used to identify critical paths for Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) planning
- This is a management process that may/may not involve security office
- Methods for conducting BIA
	- Survey
	- Financial Audit
	- Customer Response
	- Industry standards & best practices

Employee Agreements and Policies
- Employee Contract - Terms of employment, payment, performance.
- Employee Handbook - Policies and standards all personnel required to follow
- Non-Disclosure Agreement - Formal agreement signed to no disclosed unauthorised info

Security Control Frameworks (SCFs)
- PCI DSS - SWIFT's "Customer Security Controls Framework" (Banking/payment cards)
- Cloud Security Alliance: Internet of Things SCF
- HITRUST, NIST, COBIT, Center for Internet Security (CIS)
- GDPR (EU), HIPAA (Medical)

Type of Investigation
- Civil Investigation
	- Civil cases usually allow greater breadth of evidence presented more liberally then criminal cases
	- Burden of proof is lower for civil cases than criminal
- Regulatory Investigation
	- Regulators may conduct their own investigations without law enforcement
	- Regulators have force of law but lower threshold of access (eg. not require warrants)
- Criminal Investigation
	- Law enforcement must be notified, unless victim org chooses to handle in a non-judicial manner.
- Administrative Investigation
	- Contained within organisation - internal function

Threat Modelling
- STRIDE - Microsoft tool for software developer threat classification
	- Spoofing (Identity)
	- Tampering (with Data)
	- Repudiation - Deny/conceal participation in transaction
	- Information Disclosure - Breach
	- Denial of Service (DoS)
	- Elevation of Privilege
- OCTAVE - Carnegie-Mellon model for overall IT system risk
	- OCTAVE for large orgs, OCTAVE-S for smaller ones
	- "Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE)"
- Trike - Open-source methology from MIT

What is at Risk?
- Four perspectives
	- Asset-based
	- Outcomes-based
	- Vulnerability-based
	- Threat-based
- Threat intelligence activities
- Vulnerabilities
- Continuous process maturation and improvement
- Assets and asset valuation

Control Types
- Physical
- Technical/Logical
- Administrative

Control Classification
- Preventative
- Detective
- Corrective
- Deterrent
- Recovery
- Compensative

When to use Which Assessment Technique
- Use Qualitative
	- Newness: When activity, context, marketpalce or organisation is too new to have any significant track record to use for measurement
	- Uniqueness: Organisation believes their way of doing things is so unique that no other industry experience can compare
	- Lack of time, money, talent to make the measurements
	- No reliable, accurate measuring method to gather enough data
- Use Quantitative
	- Business processes involve well understood risks
	- Measurement technique with required precision and reliability are available
	- Experience with processes will produce enough data for a statistically significant result (without a sufficiently large sample size the quantitative assessment won't be statistically significant)

Risk Associated with Hardware, Software and Services
- Hardware: Unique dedicated and legacy systems
- Software: Bugs and Zero-day exploits
- Services: 3rd party attacks on supply chain
