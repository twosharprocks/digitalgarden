# Algernon
This was my first shift across from Linux into Windows, and I'll freely admit to being a little overwhelmed at all the open ports and not knowing quite where to start. Realising the FTP had an anonymous login was straight forward, and identifiying the `admin` user from the logs was nice, but it turned out to be a deadend and the real solution was 10x easier than what I'd experienced with the last few Linux boxes - I really needed to reset my expectations.

Sure, the Windows boxes have a mountain of open ports and the options are overwhelming for enumeration, but if anything that makes things easier. In this case, it was as easy as checking the website on port `9998`, identifying a vulnerable service, and running an appropriate exploit against it to get RCE. The exploit gave me access as Administrator too, so there wasn't even PrivEsc to tackle here.

All around this was a ***very*** easy box compared to what I've just been doing, but it was an excellent reminder on enumerating Windows services and the process you need to follow when you're attacking a Windows machine. There aren't many notes to add to your cheat sheet for this one... although it's probably worth keeping `type C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\proof.txt` on a quick reference when you get access and don't know where to find the proof file!

# Resolution summary
- Ran Nmap to identify ports `21`, `80`, `135`, `139`, `445` & `9998`
- Identified port `9998` as running `SmarterMail`
- Found exploit for `SmarterMail` that allowed unauthenticated remote code execution
- Ran exploit and gained initial access as `System` - navigated to Administrator desktop and printed `proof.txt`
## Improved skills
- Exploit identification
## Used tools
- nmap
- ftp
- gobuster
- python
