<p>What do you really want to do before you die? It&rsquo;s a tough question, and one that&rsquo;s even tougher to contemplate. You&rsquo;re 40 in a few months, which is wild considering you never thought you&rsquo;d make it to 30. Now you talk about being lucky to make 70&hellip; maybe you need to ask yourself why you didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d make it to 30, as well as what you&rsquo;d do if you made it to 80 and have another 40 years of life ahead of you.</p>
<p>But the question is what you want to do before you die, and not if you&rsquo;ll live to 80. You want to shed all the excess, all the attachments you have - to be a completed book without loose ends or appendices. You have <em><strong>books to write</strong></em>, and it&rsquo;s nice to acknowledge that you&rsquo;d spend your last days writing if you could. It&rsquo;s not about being remembered, it&rsquo;s about creating something you put your whole soul into, something that utterly consumes you, that pours out of you like water, that merges with you as a person where the book is as much you as you are it.</p>
<p>Setting an arbitrary number of books to write before you die is meaningless, especially if you just use it as a timeline to measure and wipe yourself with. Writing articles for magazines and journals means less too - it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re doing 5-10 minute comedy sets again. It doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t, but the real fulfilment comes from writing full length books that you are truly proud of in the end.</p>
<p>You have so many adventures behind you that feel like emotional boat anchors, dragging along the ocean floor and tripping you up as you look at them and think &ldquo;coulda, woulda, shoulda&rdquo;. Well you have absolutely nothing to lose - write. Don&rsquo;t worry about if you&rsquo;re writing the right thing or not, just develop the things that you know are calling to you now. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to start, fuck up, change course, and start again - none of this is wasted, and returning every day to write a mini essay is exactly the kind of writing muscle you need to develop so you can write thousands of words a day again as you focus on a book.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t worry about trying to tick things off a bucket list before you die for the sake of it - figure out what you&rsquo;re going to do today, how to use the winds of circumstance to push you towards who you want to be every day, and then get up tomorrow to be a little bit better at being that person tomorrow. This is the way of the peaceful warrior, and you&rsquo;ll never &ldquo;achieve&rdquo; it - you can only walk it each day.</p>
