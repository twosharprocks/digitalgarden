==Review== How are you feeling?
I&rsquo;m tired and sore from being sick. I&rsquo;ve been coughing up chesty shit all day and now my neck and head hurt from coughing so much. I&rsquo;m also worried about having shared [[50 Goals]] with Chloe and not seeing how she can join or be part of it. I&rsquo;ve said repeatedly that I&rsquo;m not happy with the life we&rsquo;re living, that I want to change things up but I want her to be part of that. I can&rsquo;t see her making any effort to be part of it though - she&rsquo;s not interested in what I share, and doesn&rsquo;t seem to want to make plans to do things together. The &ldquo;OK&rdquo; on the marriage proposal still hurts, and it&rsquo;s a reflection of her indifference - I know she loves me, but having me around seems like more of a convenience rather than being a co-creator in an adventurous life. Having me around makes her life easier, but she doesn&rsquo;t want to actively do anything together. Like a cat - she wants attention and activity on her terms, and is non-reactive and unsupportive of anything that she&rsquo;s not personally invested in.

<p>What are you working on?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Developing a list of places to explore in 2026. I&rsquo;m putting together a calendar of the best times to visit all the possible regions you&rsquo;d like to dive and take others to, and narrowing your list down to the places that offer you the greatest fulfilment and the logistics to support others.</p></blockquote>
<p>What you’ll do next?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;ll keep developing your interests, keep coming to terms with the changes ahead, and keep writing as much as possible so you have all your thoughts and ideas in one space where you can blend everything together. Brains are for having ideas, not storing information.</p></blockquote>
<p>What am I grateful for?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The office space I have to develop these ideas, the income from ElectraNet to support your interests, and the opportunity to build on all the skills you have and use them in ways that inspires and improves the lives of others.</p></blockquote>
